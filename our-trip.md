### How We Got Here, (or I Blame Matt Damon For the Whole Thing)

If we are honest we should credit the idea for this trip to Matt Damon and the movie &#8220;*The Bourne Supremacy*&#8220;.

You see, LeeAnne and I were reclined on the couch in what was then my house and *The Bourne Supremacy* was on TV. The movie opens with Jason Bourne and his girlfriend Marie living in Goa for the past six months, not hardship duty by any measure. Jokingly I said to LeeAnne &#8220;Can we live in Goa for six months some day too?&#8221;. She seemed to consider it a bit more seriously than I had intended, but soon responded &#8220;Yes!&#8221;.

So that&#8217;s the germ that has grown and changed shape several times, eventually becoming the trip we&#8217;re currently on. We will hit Goa at some point, and we will be gone at least six months but now we are looking at something more like a real Round the World trip. At the moment we are planning on visiting Australia, New Zealand, India, Nepal, China, Mongolia, Mauritius, Southern and Eastern Africa, Jordan and the United Kingdom.

I&#8217;m sure at times we will wish we had just stayed in Goa for six months, but hopefully we won&#8217;t wish we had stayed on the couch.
