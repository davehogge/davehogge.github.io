Ulaanbaator is a sleepy medium-size town that happens to be the capitol and only real city of any size in Mongolia. The Soviets essentially built this city and it&#8217;s painfully obvious in the architecture, monuments and city planning that the Mongolians had little say. If you were dropped in the middle of UB (as it&#8217;s known to the local ex-pat community), you could easily think you were in a Siberian factory town. Outside of Shukbaataar Square the town is composed of low-rise Soviet apartment buildings, with a rather huge ring of Ger-&#8216;burbs surrounding the city. It stands in contrast to all the new-shiny construction with a definite Asian theme we&#8217;d grown use to in China.

The Soviets didn&#8217;t just leave behind a bunch of buildings and monuments when they left. Black Russian bread and cheese, wonderful cheese (something you don&#8217;t see too much of in China) is all to easy to come by. There are still a few conspicuously Russian faces in town, and a huge, huge, three block long, one block wide Russian Embassy (they probably needed the space when they ran the country) is located within sight of the Parliament House.

The town itself is a bit sleepy, I mean that literally, at 9AM we are some of the first people out on the street &#8211; also in contrast to China. The locals themselves are proud as punch to claim Chingis Khan as one of their own. In his spirit they don&#8217;t like to stand in line, drive like maniacs and drink like &#8230;well they drink like Russians, but anyway.
