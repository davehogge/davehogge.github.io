Going hand-in-hand with vaccinations is Travel Insurance. I&#8217;ve been out and about in the world before, but have never even considered getting it. But, this is a big trip and we are grown up now, so it seems like a good time to look at it.

At the moment we are looking at a few providers, but our friends Jim & Dara have recommended IMG Global. It&#8217;s pretty comprehensive coverage. The deductibles are scaleable, and it provides up to two months of coverage after your trip ends and you&#8217;re back in the states. That&#8217;s pretty sweet.

Maybe we will use: IMG Global
