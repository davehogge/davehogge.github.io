Guilin, it&#8217;s just one of the many cities in China with over a million inhabitants that you have probably never heard of. It&#8217;s also the first real stop for us in China (we spent a night in 

[Guangzhou][1] &#8211; formerly known as Canton &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t really count as we were just there long enough to sleep). It&#8217;s also the first time in our almost five month trip that we haven&#8217;t been in a former British Colony. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve caught ourselves on a few times already. I wonder who built that tunnel? Oh, of course, the Chinese!

Guilin is located in Southwestern China, if you look at a map, it&#8217;s in the bulge just above Vietnam. It&#8217;s known all over for it&#8217;s fantastic landscape. And I do mean fantastic, it looks like something straight out of the imagination of Tolkien. It&#8217;s covered in a mist most of the day and there are huge limestone towers a few hundred meters high all over the place. The place is very green, with Bamboo and Banyan trees all over. As if that weren&#8217;t enough, huge caves have been carved out of the limestone. It&#8217;s one of the strangest landscapes we&#8217;ve seen on our travels yet.

The Southwest is populated by a large number of Ethnic minorities (AKA &#8211; Not Han Chinese) and Guilin is kind of the center of things for them. One thing I will say for these folks, they will eat anything! A look at a menu in Southwest China, or a stroll through a market is &#8230;enlightening. So far we have seen every kind of meat you can image and many you wouldn&#8217;t want to: rats, snakes, eels, pigeon, snakes, frogs, turtles, day old pigs on a skewer. It is all eaten, and the locals claim it is all delicious! For a pair of vegetarians it can make dining out a bit troublesome, but we aren&#8217;t complaining.
