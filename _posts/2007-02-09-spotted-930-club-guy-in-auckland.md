So LeeAnne and I are back in Auckland briefly before we head north to visit Sarah. We&#8217;re here primarily to finally pick up our tickets and run a few other errands around town. So after we&#8217;ve finished our business we&#8217;re walking down by the harbor right around sunset and we approach a big guy on the sidewalk. He&#8217;s wearing a black t-shirt and those 3/4 length pants and he looks tough, he has a bunch of tattoos and face piercings and he kind of looks like he should be &#8230;at the 9:30 Club in Washington DC.

LeeAnne points this out to me. And for a second we have a conversation: &#8220;Sure it&#8217;s him!&#8221; &#8220;No way&#8221;, &#8220;How could it be?&#8221;

Then, as we pass him LeeAnne says to no one in particular &#8220;I love the 9:30 Club!&#8221; and now there&#8217;s no doubt &#8211; the guy looks back at us and says something to his friends. Instead of doing anything else &#8211; like asking him why he&#8217;s there or getting a picture &#8211; we just press on. But I&#8217;d still like to know what he&#8217;s up too down here.
