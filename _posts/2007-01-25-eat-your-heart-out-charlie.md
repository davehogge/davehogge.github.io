If you&#8217;re like me, watching Willy Wonka &#038; the Chocolate Factory (the original with Gene Wilder) when you were a kid was a little disturbing.  Our tour of Cadbury World in Dunedin proved to be full of a little of that same creepiness as well as loads of chocolate goodness!  Our guide Colleen, clad in purple overalls and matching purple shoes, welcomed us to the tour with a lovely hairnet and a plastic bag to fill with a sampling of the many Cadbury bars produced there.  Living in the U.S. we certainly are not at a loss for good chocolate (according to Colleen Americans consume 16 kilos each year!), but we really are missing out on a huge variety of silly named Cadbury candy bars.  With names like Pinky, Crunchie, Dream and Curly Wurly how can you go wrong?  And some of them are quite tasty! 

The tour culminates with a 4 story, one ton chocolate waterfall.  Though it was no surprise, I still couldn&#8217;t refrain from bursting into giddy laughter.  I&#8217;m not sure whether it was the silliness of it or sheer pleasure.  The creepy part enters next when Colleen proceeds to make us cant &#8220;I love chocolate&#8221; inside the hollow silo.  It was like Willy Wonka at Latin Mass.  Weird!
