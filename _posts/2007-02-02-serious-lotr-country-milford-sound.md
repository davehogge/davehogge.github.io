Fjordland &#8211; the southwestern corner of the South Island &#8211; feels very different from the rest of the country. For one thing it&#8217;s almost all a huge temperate rain forest. So you&#8217;ll have a forest of conifers littered with huge ferns, and these crazy mountains that don&#8217;t belong in the Lord of the Rings &#8211; they&#8217;re the source material for it. It&#8217;s hard to stop thinking about the movies here &#8211; there are reminders all over.

Milford is a very isolated corner of Fjordland. There&#8217;s one road in and it&#8217;s probably one of the most dramatic/terrifying drives of my life. You pass a series of huge mountains and cross over several huge ones on the way. Then the clincher &#8211; just when you think you can&#8217;t go any higher (you can&#8217;t) you have to drive through a one way tunnel, that has no lights and is on an incline so you can&#8217;t see the end &#8211; talk about the gates to Mordor &#8211; and get this it&#8217;s &#8230;one way.

&#8220;One Way&#8221; you say, &#8220;No&#8221;! Yes, in fifteen minute intervals it&#8217;s one way each way. If it takes you more than fifteen minutes to make the trip, get ready to share the road.

We were there just after a rainfall and there were literally thousands of waterfalls of every size. Quite impressive.

We did a small boat tour &#8211; small being 75 people and it was quite nice. The captain took us in under a few waterfalls and got us quite close to the native wildlife &#8211; seals and dolphins. I&#8217;d recommend it.

Camping in a rain forest, no I won&#8217;t recommend that. We stayed at the Milford Sound Lodge and got a tent site. Which was very soon a very wet tent site. That I would not do again.

And of course we had our first encounter with the notorious Kea. Known to Kiwi&#8217;s as the &#8220;Bossiest Bird in the World&#8221;. It&#8217;s the worlds only Alpine Parrot &#8211; there was a sign at the hostel warning visitor that &#8211; &#8220;If you feed a Kea dinner, they will eat your car for desert.&#8221; It&#8217;s true, they evolved on an island that has no predators and their quite big, so they have no fear of humans.
