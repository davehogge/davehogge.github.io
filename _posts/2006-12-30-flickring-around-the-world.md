Hopefully soon we will have many many photos in here. We&#8217;re using flickr to host photos while we&#8217;re traveling. It&#8217;s easy to upload stuff from internet cafes and it beats trying to store everything on our own, and then either losing them. Besides we can share them with everyone else.
