Some of you may be aware that Dave has always dreamed of riding a mechanical bull.  Well his dream came true just the other day!  No, it wasn&#8217;t at some dirty, dusty saloon somewhere in the middle of the Outback.  Much better, it was at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Fair! 

We were en route to Newtown, a funky little Sydney neighborhood, when we came across the festivities at a local park.  We meandered through the fair listening to the rockin&#8217; music of a band that may have starred in Priscilla Queen of the Desert, trying not too look too embarrassed as we walked past the &#8220;Sydney Gay Nudists,&#8221; when we spotted the lonely mechanical bull booth in the far corner.  Dave never hesitated, and I never laughed so hard!  See for yourself.
