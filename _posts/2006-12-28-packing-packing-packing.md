Wow! We have a lot of stuff for two people traveling light around the world. It&#8217;s embarrassing telling people your traveling around the world on a shoestring and then asking their help to pull your two large duffel bags, two fully packed back-packs and two or three carry-on&#8217;s out of the car for you. Luckily, most people are forgiving, and after they have finished laughing at you they will throw in a hand.

It&#8217;s not as bad as it seems; first of all, we haven&#8217;t really even started our trip yet. We are at LeeAnnes parents house in Lisbon, Ohio for &#8220;Second Christmas&#8221;. While we are out of the house, and it will be some time before we see any parts of the east coast again, we aren&#8217;t really traveling yet are we?

Secondly, a lot of this stuff will be shed in stages (by design, not just happenstance!). We&#8217;re planning on biking and camping in New Zealand. After NZ we ditch the bike stuff, we&#8217;ll be camping a lot in Austraila so we&#8217;ll hold on to camping gear a bit longer but after Australia we ditch the that stuff.

So you see, we need all this stuff &#8230;right? Yeah, I&#8217;m not convinced either.
