So we&#8217;ve been in China for almost two weeks now and I have to say, sometimes I need to remind myself we&#8217;re in the Third World. After two months in India, being here is &#8230;refreshing.

Let&#8217;s say nothing of the fact that everything runs on time, let&#8217;s not mention how there are clean streets and sidewalks to walk on, we don&#8217;t need to discuss how when you get in a cab, you don&#8217;t feel as though you are putting your life in the cabbies hands.

From what we&#8217;ve seen, and granted we&#8217;ve only been here a little while, and all of that time has been in the more prosperous South, China has it&#8217;s story straight. The buses here are better than any buses we&#8217;ve been on during our whole trip (and way better than Greyhound), the trains are better than any other trains we&#8217;ve been on, the roads are (when paved) awesome.

China is like the opposite of India in almost every way. At times I felt like everything in India was hard, except finding vegetarian food. In China, that&#8217;s the only hard thing, everything else is easy. And I don&#8217;t even speak the language here!

In short, if this place is still considered the &#8220;developing world&#8221;, the developed world had better watch out! 

Now, some people have kind of dogged on us because we&#8217;ve come to China. Words like &#8220;Authoritarian&#8221;, &#8220;Repressive&#8221; and &#8220;Free Tibet&#8221; have been used. Some of these words we agree with ourselves. But we wanted to find out first hand what things were like, and so we&#8217;re here. Besides, if you have an iPod, own a laptop, or have bought an article of clothing in the past several years, it was probably made here.
