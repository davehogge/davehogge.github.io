The first stop in our career as car campers is Lake Tekapo &#8211; a wonderfully blue-blue (almost phony looking) lake in the Southern Alps. We&#8217;re also at a pretty high altitude, and the lake is rather remote so residents of the lake area claim to have the clearest sky&#8217;s in New Zealand.

Sadly for us, the night that we we there it was rather cloudy but there were moments when the full moon was reflected on the lake &#8211; creepy! And cold &#8211; that&#8217;s the raw end of being so high up.
