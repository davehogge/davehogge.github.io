Dali is a beautiful city with mountains on one side and a picturesque lake on the other. It&#8217;s an old walled city and unlike many of it&#8217;s ilk it has not yet been totally changed by tourism. It&#8217;s certainly one of the best cities we&#8217;ve visited yet in China. But I can&#8217;t talk too much about it in this entry. I was sick with a cold the entire time we were there and it&#8217;s overshadowed by the fact that LeeAnne and I experienced our first earthquake here.

Well, experienced may be a bit strong. It was in the middle of the night and we slept through it. But it was a 6.4 magnitude quake and it was really close so it still counts right? Here are the [details from the USGS][1].

We were fine, the Dali was unharmed, and in fact the first we heard of it was from our concerned Mothers.
