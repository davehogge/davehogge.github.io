After close calls with my Cousin [Sam Forrest][1] in both New Zealand and Shanghai, we are happy to say we have successfully made contact with my cousin Joe Bateman in London. Actually, he lives Ä±n Watford, but he was nice enough to meet up with us in Central London and show us the sights. I haven&#8217;t seen Joe in probably 20 years, but we after quickly comparing notes on the last two decades he got down to his bread and butter showing us the town. He makes a good tour guide and showed us the Tower of London, The Tower Bridge, the Southbank of the Thames, Lloyds of London, Big Ben and Parliament, Number 10 Downing Street and Trafalgar Square. He tried to take us into the National Gallery, but if we had a dime for every museum we went into on this trip we could retire for life &#8211; so we had to politely decline.

He certainly has a career as a tour guide to fall back on, but he seems to be doing well for himself in the UK &#8211; he qualifies for a passport next year and he seems very settled.
