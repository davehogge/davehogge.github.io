To appease our readers I will report that there have been no major gastrointestinal incidents in India as of yet. We are very careful about water, but have been enjoying a variety of local foods, juices (no water and no ice used) and veg (no lettuce) with little to no adverse result. 

Of course they don&#8217;t call it Delhi Belly for no reason at all! We&#8217;ll see how we fare once we hit Delhi and beyond later in the week.

Thanks for your concern! We made need it yet.
