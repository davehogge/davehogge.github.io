After a few days cooling off (literally in Munnar) we&#8217;ve headed down south to Kumily which we&#8217;ve used as a base to visit the Periyar Tiger Reserve. Count yourself extremely lucky if you see any tigers here. The reserve is huge and tigers are active mostly at night &#8230;when the reserve is closed to the public.

There are lots of other activities in and around here though: LeeAnne and I did an early morning wildlife hike with a small group and a guide from the park. About this we have to be honest: aside from wild boar, and a few monkeys there wasn&#8217;t that much wildlife to be seen, but it was still a good hike in some lovely country.

Kumily is a big Spice town. All kinds: Cardamom, Clove, Tea, everything. There are several plantations outside of town that operate tours. There are also a few places that offer Elephant rides, which I&#8217;m eager to do. We passed on the one in town that was heavy on the whips and chains approach.
