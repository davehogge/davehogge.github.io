Johannesburg is very sketchy, the crime statistics are scary and in a place where even locals don&#8217;t go out at night tourists have to adapt. As a consequence of crazy crime, the security business is booming &#8211; everyone has high masonry walls around their homes and at least one of the following on top: razor wire, barbed wire, electric fencing, or crushed glass. Every home has a sign advertising the security firm they use and many include an &#8220;Armed Response&#8221; sign as well.

In a city where it&#8217;s not safe to go out after dark almost anywhere, and many places where you can&#8217;t go day or night hostels in Jo&#8217;berg take on Orwellian proportions. Their goal is to have everything you need on site so you don&#8217;t have to leave for any other reason than to go to the museum of the airport. And when you need to go there, they also operate their own in-house taxi service to get you from A to B. The message here is: do not interact with locals.

So why would you go to Johannesburg? Good question, well, it&#8217;s a huge transportation hub, and home to the busiest airport in Africa. If you come to South Africa, you are almost certainly going to land here, or transfer here &#8211; welcome to Johannesburg.

The Malls of Johannesburg  
Here is a near complete list of &#8220;Safe&#8221; places to go in Jo&#8217;berg: The Mall, the other Mall, the Casino, and the Apartheid Museum. In our few days in Jo&#8217;Berg we spent a ridiculous amount of time at the Mall. In four days time we probably spent more time in shopping malls than we have in the last four years.

Jo&#8217;berg, the home of the happy (and safe) shopper.
