First stop on the road to Round the World Travel is the Doctors office. It may not be the most romantic or adventuresome idea, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that before the best adventurers and explorers headed out they got their shots. How much could Indiana Jones have gotten done if he were bed-ridden with Hep B while chasing the Ark of the Covanent? Not much.

Luckily for us we are based in Washington D.C. where there are a number of clinics that specialize in World Travel. After doing some shopping around we have decided to use the services of &#8220;Travelers Medical&#8221; on K St. They seem to us the best balance of cost, pratical advice, and experience. Contact detals are below.

That said, vaccinations are not cheap: We will probably drop around $1000 USD, on shots, vaccinations and anti-malarials.

As LeeAnne is a RPCV (Returned Peace Corp Volunteer) she is way in front of me in terms of vaccinations. I will need the works, even my Tetnis boosters are behind.
