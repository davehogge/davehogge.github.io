Some of you know our friend Lorraine (aka cycling fool). Well if you do, then you are aware that she is one great lady.  It should come as no surprise then that her family in Adelaide are equally awesome.  We felt they were deserving of their very own entry!

Just before leaving for our big trip, Lorraine offered a place for us to stay with her family in Adelaide.  It turned to be even more than our own little bungalow where we could relax at the end of the day.  Her brother Dean helped to coordinate our visit, picked up mail for us, gave us a tour of the city on his day off and even pointed us towards a camera store when our stuff was stolen.  We had just a brief visit with Mum, but she was a delight. Telling great stories of her whirlwind adventures all over the U.S. and Europe with Lorraine. Quite the AFL fan too!  We&#8217;re sorry that we didn&#8217;t get to spend time with the rest of the family, but alas, we had to make the trek back to Sydney with the car sooner or later.

Despite our bad luck at the beach in Adelaide, the Cook family made our stay there very comfortable and very memorable.  As with all our hosts, we hope to return the favor some day.
