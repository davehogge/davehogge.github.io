When Kiwis go on vacation they go to Northland. It&#8217;s the peninsula north of Auckland, and you&#8217;re sandwiched in between the South Pacific and the Tasman sea, so there are loads of beach options. It&#8217;s where most of the Maori population is located these days too.

We&#8217;ve been bouncing around up here visiting Russell &#8211; the original capital of the country &#8211; now a sleepy resort town in the beautiful Bay of Islands, Cape Keri Keri, a peninsula jutting out into the South Pacific up near the very top of the North Island, and the Waipoua forest over on the west coast &#8211; home to the Kauri. Kauri&#8217;s are kind of like New Zealand&#8217;s version of a Redwoods, huge and very old.
