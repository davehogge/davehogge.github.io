There are a couple of angles I could take with this particular country wrap-up. One is: Jordan &#8211; the only country we&#8217;ve visited to be ruled by a former guest star on Star Trek (It&#8217;s true &#8211; King Abdullah is a huge fan of Star Trek and worked his connection to get an appearance on an episode of Star Trek: Voyager. Which episode? I&#8217;m glad you asked: Episode 36 &#8211; &#8220;[Investigations][1]&#8220;. 

A Second Angle: Jordan, the tiny country that keeps getting bigger! Jordan borders on some, well, let&#8217;s call them &#8220;tricky&#8221; parts of the world. It has Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Israel for neighbors. When bad things happen in those countries &#8211; have you read the news in the past 60 years? &#8211; people come to Jordan for refuge. As a result it&#8217;s actually a little tricky finding a Jordanian in Jordan. There&#8217;s a constant influx of refugees so it&#8217;s sometimes easier to find an Iraqi, or Palestinian than a real Red, Green and Black Jordanian. Interesting Factoid &#8211; in 1947 Amman, the capitol, had a population of 35,000 people, today it&#8217;s 3 million &#8211; The Middle Easts pain is Jordan&#8217;s gain. 

A Third Angle &#8211; Jordan, It&#8217;s Holy in three religions! It&#8217;s in the Torah, the Bible and the Koran. It&#8217;s geographically small, but full of places referenced in the Good Books of three major religions. Give yourself a week in Jordan and you&#8217;ll give yourself a refresher course in just about everything you need to know about Allah, Yahweh and JC.
