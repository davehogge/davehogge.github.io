It seems Adelaide has something of a self-image problem. It&#8217;s not hard to understand why &#8211; with competition like Sydney &#038; Melbourne it&#8217;s easy to think of oneself as a little provincial. I can assure you this is not the case. Adelaide is a great jumping off point to many points of interest in South Australia.

To the east you&#8217;ve got the Great Ocean Road, to the west you&#8217;ve got Kangaroo Island &#8211; one of the best places in the country to see wildlife in the wild. If you go north you&#8217;ve got some of the most prolific wine regions in the world, and if you go south there are ten beaches to choose from. Not too shabby.

The city itself reminds me of somewhere in the Southwest US. It&#8217;s dry and sunny here most of the year and the local architecture reflects that. Lots of low, wide homes built with masonry and nice decks rather than over the top lawns.

And in town, despite what they may say in Melbourne or Sydney, there&#8217;s a lot going on. We&#8217;re here during the Adelaide Film Festival, there&#8217;s a Grand Prix in town, and we&#8217;re leaving just before the start of a World Music Festival and Fringe Festival. Oh, and AFL (Aussie Rules Football) is just getting ready to start up again.

Oh, and whatever else they may say &#8230;Adelaide is the capitol of South Australia and the only colony in Oz not founded by convicts. Suck on that New South Wales &#038; Victoria!
