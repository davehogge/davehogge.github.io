For a couple of months we have been considering trying to work in some Bicycle touring as part of our travel. It didn&#8217;t take too long to identfy New Zealand as the place we wanted to do it in. It&#8217;s suppose to be one of the best places in the world for touring and camping.

The decision that did cause a lot of gnashing of teeth is: should we take our own bikes and ship them back when we&#8217;re done in New Zealand, or should we rent?

The best case senario would be to take our own bikes and ship them home on a slow boat. But we have had some trouble figuring out how much that would cost and how long it would take. Plus, it&#8217;s always a bit of a hassle to get the bikes boxed and on the plans. So, we have decided to rent. It will probably cost less and save wear-and-tear on our own equipment. It helps that we found a bike co-op in Auckland (called Adventure Cycles) that seem very friendly and knowledgeable about things. Their contact details are below.
