We&#8217;re in! Well, almost &#8230;we&#8217;re crossing the border in a few hours, but LeeAnne was given a Visa. Just a ten day visa, but we&#8217;re hoping to get an extension in-country. Barring that, we&#8217;ll return to Hong Kong and reapply for a 30 day visa through a travel agency. We&#8217;ve been told they may know what gears to grease, wink-wink.

Anyway, we&#8217;re very excited. It&#8217;s a big turn around from the day before yesterday, when things just were not going right for us. So hopefully, our next report to you will be from the other side of the border.
