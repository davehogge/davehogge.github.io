Move over Ping-Pong, make room for Basketball. The NBA is surprisingly huge here. After Soccer it&#8217;s probably the biggest spectator sport in the country. The NBA play-offs are broadcast twice a day here, live at 8AM in the morning and then again at night, followed by a highlights show with Chinese talking heads summarizing the game. We were woken one morning by excited Chinese San Antonio Spurs fans cheering on Tim Duncan and crew a few doors down.

And basketball has kind of a surprising poster-boy here, everyone knows Yao Ming, but the player with the most exposure in China right now is &#8230;Shane Battier?

Yes, Shan Bati-rrr (as it&#8217;s pronounced here) is everywhere! His handsome mug is plastered over billboards, city buses and his commercials play on TV all the time. You&#8217;d think this kid was the next Jordan the way China has embraced him.

So, the obvious question: Why Shane Battier? Well, rather than take a B-List or C-List contract with Nike, Shane chose to sign an endorsement deal with &#8220;Peak&#8221; sportswear, a China based rival. Thus instant Superstardom for Shane &#8211; in China.
