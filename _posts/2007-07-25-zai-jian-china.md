China is not a developing nation, it&#8217;s developed. And we all might understand soon just how developed they are. I&#8217;ve never met a people who are more determined to make an impression on the world than these folks. Today China, tomorrow &#8211; well, probably Taiwan &#8211; but then &#8230;the World!

Hostels in China are terrific. The number and quality of them surprised us, lots of YHA options these days too, so get your membership before you arrive. Generally, they are cheap and most are either new or only 4 or 5 years old, so everything is shiny and new. Transportation in China also really surprised and impressed us. We were blown away by how modern the road network was and the buses were very comfortable. Now, bear in mind were were coming from India where the transportation system leaves something to be desired, so in comparison China ruled.

In terms of sights and things to do, the culture and natural beauty of the Southwest trumped the monuments and architecture of the North and East. Go to Tiger Leaping Gorge before the Dam is completed, see the South-West if at all possible, you will be greatly rewarded. Make time for it, shaving a few days off your time in Beijing or Shanghai will pay off. 

China is the place I most wanted to visit before this trip an so far it&#8217;s the place I most want to come back to. Thanks China, have a great time ruling the World, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll do a great job.
