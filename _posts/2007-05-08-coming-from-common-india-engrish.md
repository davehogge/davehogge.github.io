There are a few phrases that any visitor to India will become familiar with rapidly. Here&#8217;s a quick run-down of common &#8220;Engrish&#8221; you&#8217;ll come across:

Coming From? &#8211; The most benign, they just want to know what country you&#8217;re from. You&#8217;ll get this from interested people in the country, cabbies and people that are generally interested in where these strange Westerners come from.

One Pen? &#8211; Carry a bag of US Pennies around India and you will instantly win friends among the countries youth. One Pen, or One Penny? is a common request for a coin from your home country. Almost always from the cutest little non-ragamuffin kids you&#8217;d ever want to meet.

Pleez Maydamn, Pleez Seer&#8230; &#8211; Speaking of ragamuffins. This is the common cry of beggars, usually with one or more dirty children in town. Responding in any way is a form of encouragement to them.

Come Shee My Schop? &#8211; Walk down any street and you will be invited in to look at &#8230;well crap. Usually a Shawl, Pashmina, or jewelry. For some reason, these are always directed to me instead of LeeAnne. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s because the think I wear the pants in the family or if &#8230;well, let&#8217;s move on.

No Baksheesh? &#8211; This will come from the guy in the museum that approached you, was a little too friendly, and knew a little too much about the exhibit. You may not know it, but he has decided that he is your guide, and you owe him a tip. Before you leave the exhibit, he wants his, it makes no matter that he approached you, not the other way around.

There are certainly many more, but I just wanted to give you a kind of top 5. Remember, bring Pennies &#8211; make Friends.
