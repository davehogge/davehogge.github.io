Call it bad luck, call it damn bad luck. But we have had a heck of a time recently finding a machine and a connection to upload photos from. For this we apologized. 

Even if we can&#8217;t see what we&#8217;re posting you could, but recently we&#8217;ve either been in towns with no internet cafe&#8217;s, or towns with internet cafes and crap connections, or towns with good connections and machines so locked down we can&#8217;t even run the Flickr Uploadr. 

We are aware of the situation and are trying to rectify it. Please bear with us.
