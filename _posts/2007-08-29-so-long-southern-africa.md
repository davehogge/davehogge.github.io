I feel like we owe Africa another trip. Five weeks here just doesn&#8217;t do this wonder corner of the world justice. We&#8217;ve had a chance to pop around a bit in Southern Africa, but I feel like we just peeped through a keyhole and the place has a lot more to offer.

That said, Southern Africa is a land of great countryside and crappy cities. That&#8217;s really true through out the world, but everything here seems to be amplified. The countryside is greater and the cities are much worse (Cape Town excluded) than almost everywhere else we&#8217;ve visited. And in terms of wildlife, S. Africa has the world beat, there&#8217;s an amazing diversity of things to see here.

To top it all off, it&#8217;s one of the few places we&#8217;ve traveled so far where the American Dollar is still strong! Thank goodness the currencies of Southern Africa are falling in value faster than the dollar, because you&#8217;ll need them all. Because transportation is so spotty and semi functional in this part of the world to get around you&#8217;ll either need to hire a car and drive yourself around or book yourself on a package tour &#8211; and neither option is cheap.

Travel in Southern Africa is one of the parts of the trip I have to admit I wasn&#8217;t super excited about, but it&#8217;s really exceeded all of my expectations, and I have to recommend you look into it.
