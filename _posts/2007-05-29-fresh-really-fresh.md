One thing you can&#8217;t say about Chinese food is that it isn&#8217;t fresh, no frozen peas need apply. As a way of demonstrating let me relate something that happened to LeeAnne and I just the other day on the way back to our room:

It was a fine Sunday afternoon, we were walking down a busy street when a &#8220;FLAP!&#8221; a fish jumps in our way. We were walking past a restaurant that was so keen to demonstrate how fresh their food was, they let the ingredients meet you at the door. In this case a rather large fish jumped out of the kiddy pool he was being kept in to kind of say to us &#8211; &#8220;Come on in, this place is great! Really, you should try the chicken!&#8221;

Fish are not the only things waiting for you at the door of many places &#8211; ducks, chicken, snakes, rabbits, hermit crabs. If you had it as a childhood pet, you can have it for dinner here in China. Meats are not the only thing that&#8217;s super-fresh, the fruit and veg you have here will probably have been up on a tree or in the ground not that long ago. The Chinese will not tolerate food that isn&#8217;t fresh.

Which is great for us, as we have very weak Chinese language skills we can just walk up to a lot of places and point at what we want and shake our heads at what we don&#8217;t want. Green peppers &#8211; nod, onions &#8211; nod. Eel &#8211; head-shake, pigeon &#8211; head-shake. We&#8217;re making it work.
