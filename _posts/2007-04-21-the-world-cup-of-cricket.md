One of the things we were excited about was being in India during the World Cup of Cricket. We arrived in Mumbai just a few days before the first match and were anticipating a huge outpouring of support for the national team from India&#8217;s billion plus people. Sadly, India went out of the cup in the first round, so there was really little more than a whimper on the street.

But there&#8217;s still Cricket on TV, lot&#8217;s of it! The World Cup goes on (much like the game itself) FOREVER! It&#8217;s a two month tournament! So there&#8217;s been plenty of opportunity for LeeAnne and I to learn a thing or two about the game, sadly we haven&#8217;t. I have learned that Australia are very good. South Africa is good. And people in Pakistan value their Cricket highly (the Pakistani&#8217;s coach was murdered after they were knocked out in the first round). Beyond that, not much.

Still there&#8217;s plenty of games and commentary on the TV. There&#8217;s also a surprising amount of Soccer on TV (thank God!). We had the chance to see a Liverpool game broadcast in Hindi, and we even caught highlights of DC United&#8217;s game against Chivas in the Champions Cup.
