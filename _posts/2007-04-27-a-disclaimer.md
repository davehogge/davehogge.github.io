With all of our frank musings about India, we realize that we might seem ethnocentric or judgemental to some. That is not our intention. And yes, we do like it here most of the time. 

As you travel through any developing country &#8211; or any country that is just different from your own &#8211; you&#8217;re faced with all kinds of different experiences. We frequently struggle to understand and make sense of what we see. Here, in India, it is the absolute poverty of far too many and the way people seem to ignore their environment. In Australia it was the hidden presence of the Aboriginal people. This trip is not just about seeing the world, but trying to make sense of it too.

So understand that sometimes we might be sarcastic or a little too honest, but don&#8217;t think that we don&#8217;t enjoy our adventures. Our intention is to share with you what we ourselves find interesting and sometimes challenging.
