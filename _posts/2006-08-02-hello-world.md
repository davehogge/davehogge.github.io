Maybe we need to explain a little about why we are doing this: LeeAnne and I have always had a bit of the wander lust. She&#8217;s a Returned Peace Corp Volunteer and I&#8217;m know in my office as &#8220;The Guy That Leaves, But Then Comes Back&#8221;, or &#8220;TGTLBTCB&#8221; for short. I tend to take months long sebaticals to ride my bike across the US or Australia, etc.

So it&#8217;s probably a good thing we found each other. We have been planning something like this trip since before we were married in August 2004. But why exactly? Couldn&#8217;t tell you. There&#8217;s somthing about both of us that wants to get out there and see our share of the world. That&#8217;s about the best way I can sum it up.

So 2007 will be our year to travel, experience and hopefully learn a little bit more about our share of what&#8217;s out there. Will this cure our wanderlust? Probably not, but it should slack our thirst for a while, and hopefully we will be the better for it.
