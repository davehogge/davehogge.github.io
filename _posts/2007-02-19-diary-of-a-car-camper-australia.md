We&#8217;re leaving Sydney and car camping again. If you&#8217;ll recall we were [hooked up in New Zealand][1] with a very chear rental. In Australia, not so lucky. Still lucky, we have it for $29.00 a day AUD, and it&#8217;s a much sweeter ride. It&#8217;s a Corolla just like we had in New Zealand, but a 2006 model rather than a 1996 model like we had over there.

We got it from [Buget.com.au][2] their price was better than anything else saw &#8211; it even beat [kayak][3].

We&#8217;ll have it for about three weeks. Unlimited milage, but we can&#8217;t take it into the Northern Territory or Western Australia. The only thing that is taking some getting use to is that this rental &#8211; unlike what we had in New Zealand &#8211; is a stick shift, on the wrong side! So it&#8217;s taken a bit to get use to shifting with the left hand &#8211; oh, and the flashers and windshield wipers are on the opposite side to, so for the first few days we were flipping on the wipers ever time we wanted to make a turn. LeeAnne has a little better handle on things so she gets to do the city driving. No worries mate.
