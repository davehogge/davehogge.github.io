&#8220;So what ever happened to that crazy couple that were going around the world? Where are they now?&#8221; The quick answer is, geographically we are back in the U.S. at home in Washington, D.C. where we are looking forward to returning to normal life and everything (good and bad) that that entails &#8211; Jobs, Mortgage, Health Insurance, Pets &#8211; bring it on. 

This trip has been great, we are so thankful that we had the opportunity to do it, and we would encourage more people to do something like it. It&#8217;s really not as hard to do as it seems. We&#8217;re pretty much done now, but for anyone out there considering doing a big trip we are ready to help out in any way we can drop us a line. 

And another answer to the question we started this post out with, &#8220;Where are they now?&#8221; &#8211; We&#8217;re still on the web. You can follow our continuing life adventures at [davidhogge.com][1] and [leeanneadams.com][2] respectively. So long for now, and thanks for everything.
