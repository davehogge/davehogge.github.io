Ticket Plan B – Okay, so we're going to use a travel agent in Ireland to purchase our RTW tickets, fly there a few days before we "Originate" our One World Explorer tickets and then fly to New Zealand. Crazy, yes, but it's going to save us a bunch on ticket costs.

We're been talking with some very helpful folks over the past few days at Trailfinders in Dublin. They'll be able to purchase the tickets for us at an Ireland price. And they have offices in Australia, so if we decide to rent a car there, we may use them there as well.
