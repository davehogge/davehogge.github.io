<p>Ticket Plan B &#8211; Okay, so we&#8217;re going to use a travel agent in Ireland to purchase our RTW tickets, fly there a few days before we &#8220;Originate&#8221; our One World Explorer tickets and then fly to New Zealand. Crazy, yes, but it&#8217;s going to save us a bunch on ticket costs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re been talking with some very helpful folks over the past few days at Trailfinders in Dublin. They&#8217;ll be able to purchase the tickets for us at an Ireland price. And they have offices in Australia, so if we decide to rent a car there, we may use them there as well.</p>
