The three things that stand out about food here in New Zealand are their love of (In order) Ice Cream, Pumpkins and Sweet Potatoes (known locally as Kumara).

Let&#8217;s cover the last first, when I first saw it listed on the menu I just assumed that Kumara was a strange type of sausage. But it seems that Kumara is the name of a type of Polynesian sweet potato, brought here by the Maouri; and when combined with deep fryers, brought here by the English you have Kumara Fries. 

Sweet, sweet Kumara fries. If that isn&#8217;t a lesson in the benefits of social integration between Europeans and the native Maouri nothing is.

Secondly, pumpkins. Kiwi&#8217;s can&#8217;t get enough of them. They are pumpkin crazy! Of our first three meals here two of them had a pumpkin ingredients. You can find pumpkin in your curry, pumpkin in your hummus, pumpkin in your soup and pumpkin sliced or diced in your produce section &#8211; when it&#8217;s out of season. I&#8217;m still investigating how this fascination with the pumpkin began, and my work is delicious.

And lastly, Hokey Pokie &#8211; or really ice cream in general &#8211; or really dairy in general. They love it, which is good because there are a lot of cows down here. 

There are no convenience store here, they&#8217;re called &#8220;The Dairy&#8221;. Milk and ice cream are everywhere.  
In the states we think we have flavored milk right? Chocolate milk is fun and tasty. Down here they have chocolate, banana, strawberry and &#8230;lime. Yes! Lime flavored milk, but how does it taste you ask? Delicious. This is a million dollar idea they&#8217;re sitting on, someone should patent it.

And then there&#8217;s ice cream. It&#8217;s a national obsession, every day we see people eating it, LOTS of it. And the big kahuna of flavors is Hokey Pokey. I have no idea what it is, maybe just a mishmash of other flavors all rolled into one, but they can&#8217;t get enough of it.

So there you go, no need for &#8216;Got Milk&#8217; ad&#8217;s down here, they have it covered. And if you&#8217;re lactose intolerant, maybe they&#8217;ll let you move to Australia, because you aren&#8217;t going to do too well here.
