So I needed a haircut some kind of bad. I haven&#8217;t had my ears lowered since before Christmas. I&#8217;d been holding out for some time, but the 110 degree heat in Delhi, combined with to opportunity to get a haircut on the street was too good to pass up.

We spotted this gentleman cutting hair when we went to the Sarojini Nagar Bazzar in South Delhi. I have to say he did an excellent job, but I still think I was over charged &#8211; two dollars for a haircut, and 5 minute head massage, and the offer of a shave with a straight razor (which was politely declined) seems excessive. Especially because I drummed up so much business for him &#8211; let me tell you, a white man getting a haircut on the street in India attracts a crowd.

Anyway, he did a great job, especially considering I have no Hindi and he had no English. We had the shop-owner next door work a little translation for us &#8211; &#8220;Long?&#8221;, &#8220;Short?&#8221;, &#8220;Ah, Medium!&#8221;. 

Here&#8217;s some video of the head massage:
