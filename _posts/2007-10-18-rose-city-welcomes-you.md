Having flights left on our [OneWorld Ticket][1] and friends in Oregon to visit we headed off to PDX. Portland, with it&#8217;s rivers and bridges, it&#8217;s mountains, manageable city size (and professional soccer team), has long been near the top of the relocation list for LeeAnne and I. In all honesty at the beginning of the trip I thought we may be looking to move out there when we returned to the States. But being away from everyone you know for the better part of a year changes what you want sometimes, and at the moment I don&#8217;t think we want to move to a new city, make new friends, and start things all over. We&#8217;ve kind of been doing that every three to four days for the last year.

So a visit it is, although our Portland hosts Suzanne and Jeff did offer to hook us up with a real estate agent before we got into town and there was a bit of heavy questioning about just why we wouldn&#8217;t be moving to Portland ASAP (FYI &#8211; If PDX had an MLS team rather than a minor league soccer team, it would help). 

We did many of the Portland &#8220;Must Do&#8217;s&#8221;. We went to [Powells City of Books][2], the book store that takes up a whole city block downtown. We rode bikes in the rain. We ate at [Voodoo Doughnuts][3]. We were rained on. We skipped the Rose garden (but we had been there before). And we drank Fair Trade coffee at a vegan bakery from mugs made on site by local peoples with special needs &#8230;as it rained outside.
