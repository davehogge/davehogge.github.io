I&#8217;m sure Sam Walton is spinning in his grave. The man who billed his store as &#8220;All-American, and American Made&#8221; now has a huge business in China, with All-Chinese made products.

We&#8217;re in [Kunming][1], the capitol of Yunnan Province in the South-west of China, and our room is right around the corner from Yunnan&#8217;s first Walmart &#8230;how could we resist?

I have to say, our trip to Walmart was eerie, everything is exactly the same, except better. There&#8217;s someone at the from door to greet you, there are those silly Walmart &#8220;happy faces&#8221; on all the store advertisements. The workers wear the same uniforms, only the vests have the Walmart slogans in Chinese characters.

The two biggest differences: Walmart workers here are all in a union (albeit a union that demands they work even harder, longer and more cheaply than even their American counterparts), and all the food at this Walmart was completely fresh &#8211; We have now been to a Walmart that has a bakery on the premises, a butcher that lets you pick out your own cuts of meat, and fruits and vegetables that don&#8217;t look like crap. Amazing, we owe it all to you Sam!
