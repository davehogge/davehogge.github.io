A really fun part of life down here is that ever major city has an outdoor movie venue and most weeknight during the year you can go to the city park, pack a picnic and see a film under the stars. It&#8217;s called [Moonlight Movies][1] It&#8217;s kind of like DC&#8217;s &#8220;Screen on the Green&#8221;, but the movies don&#8217;t suck and some times they&#8217;re films still in theaters, some times they&#8217;re &#8220;recent classics&#8221;.

This weekend is Sydney we had a chance to catch [Topfest][2]. A very cool short film contest (no film can be over seven minutes long) that takes entries from around Australia. This weekend they showed the 16 finalists at the Sydney Domain. So it&#8217;s a full evening of entrainment for free and if you aren&#8217;t into the film just wait &#8211; there will be another one on in 7 minutes or less.
