The truth about Beijing, if you&#8217;ve been in China a while, is you only need a few days to see the sights, then get out &#8230;unless you want to go shopping. Then you could be there a month.

Beijing is like many other major Chinese cites: big, crowded, noisy and polluted. After you&#8217;ve seen sights I&#8217;d advise you to get out or get shopping. The two biggest advantages Beijing has over other cities is it&#8217;s connected-ness to the rest of China by plane bus and rail, and it&#8217;s abundance of bargain shopping outlets. Also, I understand they are having the Olympics here next year.

After a day in Beijing it&#8217;s impossible to not know where the 2008 Olympics are being held. The whole city is working 24/7 on the preparations and &#8220;One World, One Dream&#8221; is pasted everywhere. It&#8217;s even pasted up on the Great Wall. After the Olympics are over everyone in Beijing should be entitled to a good sleep, it will be well deserved.

As for the sights and shopping, they will be here forever. We went to the &#8220;Big Four&#8221; &#8211; The Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, the Great Wall and IKEA.

But the first sight we took in was the smog, it was remarkable. We&#8217;d heard a lot about the pollution in China, but hadn&#8217;t really seen anything that bad in our first month and a half here. But on the train back from Mongolia we had a chance to check it out, and live in it for our first two days in Beijing. Now I understand &#8211; it&#8217;s very impressive. We were at one end of Tiananmen Square and could hardly see the opposite end.

Luckily for us a storm rolled through and cleared all the muck out of the air for us after a couple of days, leaving us with breathable air. Rumor has it the government is going to restrict personal automobile traffic in Beijing for a month next year to try and limit the smog during the games. Hope it helps.

So our visit to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City really was like a walk through the clouds &#8211; &#8220;Can you see it over there?&#8221; &#8220;What?&#8221; &#8220;Nevermind.&#8221; And sadly, we must report that the Starbucks in the Forbidden City has closed. We got there a week late. 

More interesting was our visit to Beijings other &#8220;City&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;[Underground City][1]&#8220;, constructed at the height of the Cold War when Mao was anticipating a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union any day. It&#8217;s pretty crazy (and much cooler than top-side Beijing in July). They tunneled out many miles and built factories, theaters, etc all underground. Now, you can pay 20 Yuan and get a tour of it.

Making up for a somewhat lackluster visit to the downtown sites we headed up to the Great Wall the following day. The Wall is pretty amazing and if you get there early enough you&#8217;ll miss the mad crowds. Also, did you know there is a slide from the top to the bottom? I had no idea! It&#8217;s a few hundred feet long and and looks like a lot of fun.

Our last stop was IKEA. We have no furniture needs, we just went to see one of the biggest IKEA&#8217;s in the world and eat cheap ice cream. Note &#8211; Alcohol is not regulated in China the same way it is in the States, so at the IKEA Cafe you can order a beer, wine (like LeeAnne did) or hard liquor. Sometimes you need that to shop here I guess.

IKEA was actually only the first stop on what was suppose to be a tour of the [Beijing Olympic Stadium][2] and Olympic Park. But we never got there &#8211; it had nothing to do with the wine. After our ice cream we determined the only way to get out to the park was by taxi &#8211; the Metro line there isn&#8217;t open yet &#8211; and we didn&#8217;t want to pay $30 in cab fare that day. It&#8217;s a decision I kind of regret as the stadium design is very impressive. It&#8217;s ultra-modern &#8211; the whole thing looks like a seven story high birds nest. But, it&#8217;s okay, I have a feeling it will be on TV some next summer.
