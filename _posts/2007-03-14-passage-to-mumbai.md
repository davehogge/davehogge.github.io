So we&#8217;re getting on a plane bound for India this afternoon, and we&#8217;re full of excitement and anticipation. We&#8217;re also sadly saying good-bye to things like clean tap water, salads and the ubiquitous first world flush toilet. C&#8217;est la vie.

We&#8217;re saying hello to a country in the midst of World Cup (of Cricket) frenzy. Do you know who the Captain of the India National team is? Neither do we. But I&#8217;m sure we will learn. More to come.
