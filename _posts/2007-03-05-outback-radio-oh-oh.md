One of the downsides of the outback is the dearth of radio stations available. We had grown use to pretty good radio here &#8211; much better than the states &#8211; 

[Triple J][1] is a standout. You loose all those once you leave the cities. For the most part there&#8217;s nothing on FM, and AM radio is home to crazy talk shows and live Cricket matches &#8230;we listened to more than one.

Anyhow, there are a few music based stations on AM in the outback. They play the worst music possible. I really think they can only afford music donated to them by larger stations once they have played them out. The selection is terrible &#8211; or genius &#8211; you be the judge. Here&#8217;s a block of tracks we heard as we approached Broken Hill:

*   Summer Loving &#8211; Grease Original Soundtrack
*   I Don&#8217;t Like Reggae (I Love It) &#8211; Bob Marley and The Wailers
*   USA For Africa &#8211; We Are the World
*   Give it Up &#8211; KC and the Sunshine Band
*   Tone Loc &#8211; Funky Cold Medina

&#8220;Funky Cold Medina&#8221; following up &#8220;We Are the World&#8221;!?!?! How insane is this place?
