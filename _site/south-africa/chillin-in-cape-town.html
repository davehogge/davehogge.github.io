    <p>Cape Town is easily the best city we&#8217;ve visited in Africa, by far, LeeAnne is even claiming it&#8217;s her favorite city on the whole trip (but I&#8217;m not ready to go that far yet).</p>

<p>Why all the enthusiasm? Well, this place looks great (especially since we&#8217;re coming from Johannesburg), for one &#8211; you can walk the streets (how novel!), you can even walk many streets after sunset (amazing!) and most implausibly, there are things to do here! Within a block of our hostel on Long Street there is a Vegetarian restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, a bar that shows EPL soccer, an internet cafe a movie theater and laundromat. Have we arrived or what?</p>

<p>Those are just the creature comforts, the setting is also top shelf &#8211; Table Mountain sits behind the city and the Ocean is in front. The temperature is temperate and it even rains here &#8211; take that Jo&#8217;Berg. </p>

<p>The city is centered around the harbor area, which has been made a bit too sanitized by construction of a series of malls (think Fishermans Warf in San Francisco), it&#8217;s still beautiful. You can take the San Francisco analogy a bit farther by taking a ferry from the harbor out to Robben Island &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s version of Alcatraz. Nelson Mandela was imprisoned here for much of his 27 years behind bars, now (like Alcatraz) it&#8217;s been converted into a tourist attraction.</p>

<p>One of the many highlights here is a hike up Table Mountain. It stands some 2000 meters above the city streets below, so you can guess the view from the top is special. You&#8217;ll need to get good weather to really enjoy it though. And if you&#8217;re a bit tired from the hike up, luckily you can take a Cable Car down. It&#8217;s probably the best Cable Car you&#8217;ll ever ride, to take full advantage of the scenery the car spins 360 degrees around as you descend to the bottom.</p>

<h3>Two Oceans</h3>

<p>One of the big natural attractions outside of Cape Town is the Cape of Good Hope, where the Indian and Atlantic oceans meet. It&#8217;s protected as a national park and there are lots of great hiking tracks around the Cape area. LeeAnne and I rented a car for the day and drove down for a little sightseeing and hiking. I wish we&#8217;d had more time, if we ever come back it&#8217;d be great to spend a few days there hiking and camping.</p>

<h3>Whales, Why&#8217;d It Have to Be Whales?</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s Whale season in Cape Town and on our day trip we kept our eyes open for the elusive buggers, but we didn&#8217;t spot any. We did have more luck seeing African Penguins at the hatchery in Simionstown. It&#8217;s also Penguin hatching season and we saw literally hundreds of the cute little buggers. </p>

<p>All in all, I have to say we really loved Cape Town, and would recommend it to anyone considering spending time in SA. It&#8217;s the best place here by a long shot.</p>
