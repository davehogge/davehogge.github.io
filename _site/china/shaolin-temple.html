    <p>What can I say &#8211; Lonely Planet you got it wrong again! The LP entry on Shaolin kind of disses on it, making it seem like an over-touristed slock show. LeeAnne and I went in with very low expectations, but if you&#8217;ve seen as many Kung-Fu movies as I have, going to China without visiting Shaolin Temple is like eating a peanut butter sandwich with no peanut butter. And we were greatly rewarded.</p>

<p>First, getting to Shaolin is not exactly easy. It isn&#8217;t the hardest to get to place we&#8217;ve been in China, but it did require an overnight stay in a neighboring city we didn&#8217;t particularly want to visit, a long bus ride, followed by short bus ride and some confusion over where in the heck to stay in the middle of bumkin-ville. All worth it. </p>

<p>We might have a different perspective on the whole thing if we had stayed in Zhongzheng or Dengfu and just made Shaolin a day trip. But we had heard there were a few guesthouses near the temple and if you wanted to you could actually spend the night at one of the Kung-Fu schools that dot the area. Luckily for us, when the bus dropped us off at Shaolin the we were directed by the locals to &#8220;Darhma Hall&#8221; located on the campus of a Wushu School with 7000 students between the ages of 7 and 18. That really made it worth it for us.</p>

<p>The Temple itself has been destroyed several times and the most recent reconstruction dates only from the mid-eighties, so if you&#8217;re looking for charming architecture this ain&#8217;t it. The weather when we were there was crappy, so hiking in the hills around the temple (which is suppose to be very nice), wasn&#8217;t an option. And Lonely Planet was right about one thing, there are a few too many Chinese tourists. Although the monks do put on a great Vegas inspired martial arts show in the auditorium.</p>

<p>The highlight then was staying at the school. Even though we didn&#8217;t participate in classes, we got a great look into the school just by being there and watching them practice. Nothing like spending the evening with 7,000 Kung-Fu bad-asses.</p>

<p>We also learned why China will rule the world. These kids were up at 5:30 practicing in the courtyards and after a day full of Kung-Fu, they were studying in school all night! We walked by one classroom at about 9PM on a Friday, and there they were studying their little Kung-Fu hearts out. I&#8217;m not sure, but if I&#8217;ve learned anything from Kung-Fu movies, I think they may also sleep on their heads. This place is just that hard core.</p>

<p>Lonely Planet, get it right next time &#8211; Shaolin is worth the trip!</p>
