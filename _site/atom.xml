        <title>Where Are They Now?</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So what ever happened to that crazy couple that were going around the world? Where are they now?&amp;#8221; The quick answer is, geographically we are back in the U.S. at home in Washington, D.C. where we are looking forward to returning to normal life and everything (good and bad) that that entails &amp;#8211; Jobs, Mortgage, Health Insurance, Pets &amp;#8211; bring it on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip has been great, we are so thankful that we had the opportunity to do it, and we would encourage more people to do something like it. It&amp;#8217;s really not as hard to do as it seems. We&amp;#8217;re pretty much done now, but for anyone out there considering doing a big trip we are ready to help out in any way we can drop us a line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another answer to the question we started this post out with, &amp;#8220;Where are they now?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; We&amp;#8217;re still on the web. You can follow our continuing life adventures at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidhogge.com&quot;&gt;davidhogge.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leeanneadams.com&quot;&gt;leeanneadams.com&lt;/a&gt; respectively. So long for now, and thanks for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Carbon Compensation</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/post-trip/carbon-compensation.html"/>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One more thing before we let you go &amp;#8211; and I don&amp;#8217;t want to get too &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edbegley.com/environment/&quot;&gt;Ed Begley Jr.&lt;/a&gt; here, but I think it does bear mentioning. When you travel around the world like we&amp;#8217;ve done this year there are some unseen consequences, and I&amp;#8217;m not talking about introducing Mongolian Nomads to iPods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In jet-setting around the world LeeAnne and I have done a lot of flying that we normally we wouldn&amp;#8217;t have done. And all of those jets (and buses and trains and rental cars and scooters) run on fossil fuels that are turned into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and are in turn contributing to global warming. A quick estimate of our CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; footprint leads me to believe that LeeAnne and I have contributed about 21.23 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions just from our Round the World Flights alone this year. So oddly, in trying to become better citizens of the world, we have become bad stewards too the world. A Catch-22 there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.climatecare.org&quot;&gt;climatecare.org&lt;/a&gt;. This is a site that allows you to make Carbon Offsets for all of the emissions you are responsible for. The money you put in goes to fund sustainable energy projects around the world. The site has a Carbon Calculator where you can get an idea of your own carbon footprint, and you can then purchase your own offsets, or purchase them as gifts! Hey, just in time for Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, since we&amp;#8217;ve been back there have been a lot of questions about what was our favorite place, our favorite thing to do, etc. We&amp;#8217;ll try and address that here. Some things stand out in our mind easily (like our favorite bathroom), others are a little harder to narrow down to just one thing (favorite place? too hard), so we&amp;#8217;ve put together a list of some of our favorites.

        <title>The Big Mac Index</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/the-big-mac-index.html"/>
        <updated>2007-11-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/the-big-mac-index</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I have to tell you, from a exchange rate perspective, 2007 has not been a great year to travel outside the United States. Well, at least not if you have American Dollars to change (thank you George W. Bush). The exchange rates of most of the currencies we changed for was usually worse when we left than when we arrived, it sucked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are as determined as we were to get out there and see the world, and the Dollar hasn&amp;#8217;t yet recovered, here are a few things to consider: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Stay Away from Western Europe&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; The Dollar to the Euro sucks. The Pound? Even worse. You will spend more money than you expect to here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Go to Countries with Good Exchange Rates&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; We spent about as much in a week in the United Kingdom as we did in two months in India without trying. You read that right &amp;#8211; one week, two months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Get Out of the Big Cities&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In our experience we spent about half as much in the country as we did in the cities. It may seem like there&amp;#8217;s less to do, but there is a LOT less to spend money on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Buy Less Before You Leave&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Ever heard of buying at the top? That&amp;#8217;s what you&amp;#8217;re doing ever time you buy something in the States. Example &amp;#8211; We bought a months worth of anti-malarial medication in the states. Each pill cost about ten dollars a piece. That gave us enough to get &amp;#8220;in country&amp;#8221; and find some more, or cheap. The very first pharmacy we went to in Delhi sold the exact same malarial meds for about a dollar a pill &amp;#8211; we saved nine dollars on every pill by getting the rest in India. That&amp;#8217;s Med&amp;#8217;s but the same goes for hiking shoes, quick dry clothes, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Avoid Whitey&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; When you do get out on the road, don&amp;#8217;t go to Starbucks. It&amp;#8217;s easy, it&amp;#8217;s comfortable, and very expensive. In fact, when you&amp;#8217;re out, ask locals where to eat. If you follow Lonely Planet all the time you&amp;#8217;re going to get &amp;#8220;Tourist Food&amp;#8221; all the time. It&amp;#8217;s cheaper, more fun and usually better quality to eat where the locals do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/usa/nyc.html"/>
        <updated>2007-11-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/usa/nyc</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New York City, Sinatra used to sing that if you could make it there, you could make it anywhere. For us, if we could make it there, the trip must be over. It makes sense to make this our last leg on the trip, it&amp;#8217;s the city (along with Las Vegas) that most people outside the US think of when they think about America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did we do? Not much, visited with our friend Karen and I like to think we did a self-guided walking tour of Brooklyn and Manhattan. But mostly we just hung out and walked around the city for a few days. Neither of us has been here in a while and it was fun to see how the city has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that we did have one remarkable accomplishment that should not pass without mention. Nowhere on our trip did we stoop so low, in our travels around the world not once did we even think of doing this, until we got here. We piggy-backed off of someone else bumming off of the kindness of their relatives. If you will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York hotels are expensive and we just didn&amp;#8217;t want to throw down very much cash when we came up here, so somehow we made arrangements to stay with our friend Karen from DC, who is living with her sister in Brooklyn. On the first read through that may not sink in, but we bummed off of someone that was already bumming off of someone &amp;#8211; in a New York apartment! It was cozy up in there, but we made it work. Feeling this something of a masterstroke in the art of traveling it is now entirely appropriate that we go victoriously back to DC.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Byways of Dallas</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/usa/the-byways-of-dallas.html"/>
        <updated>2007-11-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/usa/the-byways-of-dallas</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Sometimes the road less traveled...&quot; src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1061/1405584181_ddb056ee8b_z.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Sometimes the road less traveled...&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Sometimes the road less traveled...&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dallas, Texas is all together different from Oregon. Goodbye green, hello brown. Goodbye wooded mountains, hello scrubby flatlands. Goodbye rain, hello warm weather and sunny skies. So it&amp;#8217;s not all bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Portland was the City of Roses I suppose Dallas has to be the City of Byways. They love a road here, and not just roads &amp;#8211; Highway, Parkway, Tollway, Freeway, Expressway, Turnpike &amp;#8211; Dallas has them all, no shortages of roads, cars or traffic here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in town to visit LeeAnne&amp;#8217;s brother and his family, and since they are getting ready to move to Houston, we figured we&amp;#8217;d better hop to it and do some Dallas sightseeing. Dealey Plaza, where Dallas was founded and President Kennedy was shot was on the list. We visited the &amp;#8220;Sixth Floor Museum&amp;#8221; dedicated to the events in and around the shooting. We tried to visit the adjacent &amp;#8220;Conspiracy Museum&amp;#8221; but were told that it is permanently closed (Possibly that is part of the conspiracy as well). We visited Deep Ellum. We experimented with the Tollway versus the Freeway. We drove through a few toll gates that maybe we shouldn&amp;#8217;t have driven through and we drove back to Frisco and hung out with LeeAnne&amp;#8217;s Fam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a day trip to Austin, but I have to say, aside from the Tacos (which are of very high quality), and the Texas Thrift Store (also of the highest quality), Austin was kind of a letdown. Maybe we should have saved the trip for SxSW, maybe we should have gone to a taping of &amp;#8220;Austin City Limits&amp;#8221;, maybe we should have just gone Two-Stepping, but we were a bit underwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the most notable part of this leg of our trip is that we are now officially done with our OneWorld tickets! By the paper tickets we&amp;#8217;ve had with us since January, we were suppose to fly to Auckland via LA on Oct. 29, but we are headed back to DC. Is the trip over? Kind of. We may go up to New York for a few days, let&amp;#8217;s call that &amp;#8220;The End&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eugenius!!!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/usa/eugenius.html"/>
        <updated>2007-10-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/usa/eugenius</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our friends Deb and Craig moved out to Eugene, Oregon a couple of years a go and we&amp;#8217;ve never visited them. Why? Many reasons, theres nothing even resembling a direct flight to Eugene from DC. We were busily preparing for this trip a good part of the time they have been out there. And, I am highly allergic to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/rainbowpeace69/1294894388/&quot;&gt;Hippies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being only a few hours north in Portland we were obliged to pay them a visit, they are some of our best friends after all, and boy did it paid off big! Details will follow, but hold on a minute while I set the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugene is a College Town par excellence. The University of Oregon owns this town and dominates just about every facet of life in it. It is also widely known as the hippy capitol of the Pacific Northwest. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s old growth forest, the generally laid back lifestyle of people here, or the mushrooms that seem to grow everywhere, but there are tons of them here. To quote Bill Paxton from &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/&quot;&gt;Aliens&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s movement all over the place! Game Over Man, Game Over!&amp;#8221; Except in Eugene he would be talking about Hippys, not Aliens that would one day go on to fight the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/&quot;&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758730/&quot;&gt;Twice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing to know &amp;#8211; hippies make great food. Ergo, there is a lot of great organic, non-GMO&amp;#8217;ed, free range food in Eugene. I will speak of only one of them &amp;#8211; the best one in my opinion &amp;#8211; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rgweb.registerguard.com/news/2005/12/09/3.tk.bestvegpizza.1209.p1.php?section=bestof&quot;&gt;Pizza Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;. A high fluting name if you ask me, but what else would you call a pizza place that serves corn-on-the-cob on a pizza? They are out there doing the kind of research that just can&amp;#8217;t get funding here on the east coast, maybe one day we will all benefit from their sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this place is out there &amp;#8211; in a good way! The menu has a Periodic Table of Ingredients, complete with a column for the &amp;#8220;Noble Vegetables&amp;#8221; (they have put some thought into this). And if you go, and you should, do yourself a favor and put yourself in the lovin&amp;#8217; hands of the Chef and order a Chef&amp;#8217;s Special. Fifteen (15) ingredients of the chef&amp;#8217;s choosing on one pie. If listed out, the strange combinations would turn off most people (Peaches and Walnuts on a pizza, egad man!), but when administered by these Researches, it all works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to Eugene, go to the Pizza Research Institute. Call Craig and Deb and see if they can join you, but go to PRI for the love of Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rose City Welcomes You</title>

        <updated>2007-10-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/usa/rose-city-welcomes-you</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having flights left on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneworld.com/&quot;&gt;OneWorld Ticket&lt;/a&gt; and friends in Oregon to visit we headed off to PDX. Portland, with it&amp;#8217;s rivers and bridges, it&amp;#8217;s mountains, manageable city size (and professional soccer team), has long been near the top of the relocation list for LeeAnne and I. In all honesty at the beginning of the trip I thought we may be looking to move out there when we returned to the States. But being away from everyone you know for the better part of a year changes what you want sometimes, and at the moment I don&amp;#8217;t think we want to move to a new city, make new friends, and start things all over. We&amp;#8217;ve kind of been doing that every three to four days for the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a visit it is, although our Portland hosts Suzanne and Jeff did offer to hook us up with a real estate agent before we got into town and there was a bit of heavy questioning about just why we wouldn&amp;#8217;t be moving to Portland ASAP (FYI &amp;#8211; If PDX had an MLS team rather than a minor league soccer team, it would help). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did many of the Portland &amp;#8220;Must Do&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;. We went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.powells.com/&quot;&gt;Powells City of Books&lt;/a&gt;, the book store that takes up a whole city block downtown. We rode bikes in the rain. We ate at &lt;a href=&quot;http://voodoodoughnut.com&quot;&gt;Voodoo Doughnuts&lt;/a&gt;. We were rained on. We skipped the Rose garden (but we had been there before). And we drank Fair Trade coffee at a vegan bakery from mugs made on site by local peoples with special needs &amp;#8230;as it rained outside.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lisbon, Ohio LeeAnne&amp;#8217;s home town was one of our first stops on our return to the States. Lisbon is a little &lt;strike&gt;burg&lt;/strike&gt; village located in north-eastern Ohio, but it is surprisingly deep in history and dare I say it? The history of the United States may have been dramatically different without little Lisbon, Ohio. Learn the shocking truth below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village of New Lisbon was founded as a &amp;#8220;Canal Town&amp;#8221; by one Lewis Kinney in 1802. It&amp;#8217;s the second oldest town in Ohio, and home to the oldest stone house in the state. Soon after it&amp;#8217;s founding it became a center for iron and whiskey production and the population boomed from zero to over four thousand in it&amp;#8217;s first decade of existence. That rate of growth wouldn&amp;#8217;t long continue, as Lisbon&amp;#8217;s population plateaued at near four thousand for the next two hundred years or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the War of Northern Aggression the feared Confederate raider John Hunt Morgan was captured outside Lisbon after crossing the Ohio River and leading raids on various sites in Indiana and Ohio. Attempting to join his forces with General Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg, he &amp;#8211; like many others over the years &amp;#8211; could not find a way out of Columbiana County. During this time Lisbon was an active site on the Underground Railroad, and there was a strongly abolitionist newspaper published from Lisbon &amp;#8211; there were many Abolitionists in and around the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the two names that connect Lisbon with US political history are Mark Hanna and John McKinnley. McKinnley, the twenty-fifth President of the United States lived in Lisbon briefly with his grand parents. And while they met elsewhere, it was the political alliance John McKinnley formed with Lisbon native Mark Hanna that would shape both of their careers, and redefine political campaigns in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of McKinnley as a 19th century version of George Bush to Mark Hanna&amp;#8217;s Karl Rove. Something of a twit, McKinnley looked to Hanna to organize his 1896 campaign against William Jennings Bryan. Hanna raised an unprecedented amount of money and used it to organize one of the first truly national political campaigns in this country. As a result McKinnley thrashed Bryan in the polls and the new administration used it&amp;#8217;s mandate in it&amp;#8217;s first four years to focus on putting corporate interests ahead of the national interest, and administering the Spanish-American War &amp;#8211; the first war Americans would fight off the North American continent. During much of this time the President would rely on Mark Hanna for many of his most important decisions. Hmm, sound familiar to anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, McKinnley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz in 1901 and he was succeeded by Teddy Roosevelt as President. Hanna and Roosevelt had long before had a falling out and the Lisbon Gang&amp;#8217;s influence soon faded. The town just hasn&amp;#8217;t been the same since. So one way of looking at it is this, without Lisbon, and Mark Hanna, would there be any Karl Rove or Spanish American War? Without a Spanish American War would there be a Mount Rushmore with Teddy Roosevelts face on it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisbon, it&amp;#8217;s &lt;strike&gt;Hysterical&lt;/strike&gt; Historical.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lolo the Wedding Planner</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/usa/lolo-the-wedding-planner.html"/>
        <updated>2007-10-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/usa/lolo-the-wedding-planner</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you know that you are some one&amp;#8217;s good friend? When they ask you to manage their wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does someone know when you are their &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good friend? When there are almost five hundred people attending your wedding, and you say &amp;#8220;Yes&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we chose the dates we did for our return was to make it to the wedding of our friends Jeanne and Abbie. Since we were planning on being in the area and aren&amp;#8217;t yet encumbered by jobs, we offered to help in any way we could with getting ready for the big wedding day. Jeanne asked if she could employ us on the wedding day itself to kind of manage things behind the scene, so while she didn&amp;#8217;t actually plan anything and there was no radio headset to be worn, I mockingly called her Jeanne&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Wedding Planner&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wasn&amp;#8217;t the only one. At the wedding rehearsal the night before several of Jeanne&amp;#8217;s out-of-town friends took her to be a pro. &amp;#8220;How many wedding do you do a year?&amp;#8221; they asked, &amp;#8220;This is my first&amp;#8221;, (concerned look on out-of-town friends face) &amp;#8220;Oh, umm&amp;#8221;, whereupon LeeAnne explains that she&amp;#8217;s doing Jeanne a &amp;#8220;solid&amp;#8221; in repayment for the many &amp;#8220;solids&amp;#8221; we have already received from her in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was a very disconcerting moment in the rehearsal when Jeanne asked both LeeAnne and myself to stand up, and said in front of the eighty people at the wedding rehearsal (Because when you wedding is huge, your wedding rehearsal has to be also disproportionately large), &amp;#8220;If any of you have any questions tomorrow at all, find LeeAnne or Dave and they can answer them for you&amp;#8221;. Whoa, that&amp;#8217;s the first I&amp;#8217;ve heard of that. I have a hard time keeping track of myself at these events &amp;#8211; this is not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day of the wedding itself remains a blur as much for ourselves as I&amp;#8217;m sure it was for Jeanne and Abbie. Some of the events that do remain in my memory include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Flower children showing up for the service about three seconds before the march down the aisle begins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Guests showing up to the service forty-five minutes after it&amp;#8217;s begun and wondering why it&amp;#8217;s hard to find a seat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The Ethiopian band showing up 30 minutes after they&amp;#8217;re supposed to play the traditional wedding song and introduce the newylwed couple at the reception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The wedding band learning to play a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkyard_Band&quot;&gt;Junkyard Band&lt;/a&gt; Go-Go song in about five minutes before the reception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The power cutting out right before the wedding bands big finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A wedding band of the goofiest middle age white people you&amp;#8217;ve ever met preforming a Go-Go song&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, it all went off. Everything happened, there were toasts, the cake was cut, people were sat at tables, everyone worked together and made things happen. And all this with out J-Lo, and her headset. It was a great time and certainly worth changing around a schedule a bit and taking on (way) more responsibility than we thought we&amp;#8217;d have.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Back in the 202 Area Code</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/usa/back-in-the-202-area-code.html"/>
        <updated>2007-10-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/usa/back-in-the-202-area-code</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First reaction upon returning to Washington, D.C., where both LeeAnne and I have lived for over a decade: &amp;#8220;Wow! It&amp;#8217;s really small! Where are all of the people? Where is all the traffic? And pollution, what happened to that?&amp;#8221; then &amp;#8220;And Green! Geez, there are trees everywhere!&amp;#8221; I do not think that these are reactions that most visitors to the nationals capitol often have. But, you&amp;#8217;ll have to remember that we&amp;#8217;ve been traveling in China where a city of half a million like Washington DC is considered a village, and in India where sidewalks (to say nothing of intentionally planted trees and bushes) are remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of the culture shock that you hear so many returned travelers suffer from. Suffer is the wrong word, it&amp;#8217;s just a acclimation to a place you know after having your expectations (in this case expectations about overcrowding, traffic and green space) dramatically changed. I really didn&amp;#8217;t expect to be affected by it, but there we were gapping at how small our adopted city now seemed to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the better part of a year out on the road, our first objective when back home was not to see old friends, visit any of our favorite places or check in on our old colleagues, all this could wait. We needed to go directly to our storage unit and get some fresh clothes! You can&amp;#8217;t understand the joy of putting on &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; old clothes (that you already own) until you have worn the same seven pair of underwear for nine months. Going to storage that day was like going on a shopping spree somewhere that carries only clothes you love in your size. We immediately retired the clothes we had carried abroad, and vowed never to wear them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next on our list of things to do was to catch up with people. A lot can change in nine months. For example: it&amp;#8217;s exactly long enough to have a baby. A few of our friends that we left as couples were families when we returned. A few others now have buns in the oven. People have changed jobs, cities and living situations &amp;#8211; and we thought we had been busy. There&amp;#8217;s a lot to catch up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including our own neighborhood! It&amp;#8217;s very different up in the land between Columbia Heights Metro and Georgia Avenue. There&amp;#8217;s a freaking Starbucks up in the ghetto now! And restaurants: there are now options beyond the all-night Wings-Gyros-Chinese corner shops on Georgia and 14th Street &amp;#8211; amazing! It&amp;#8217;s like a yuppie bomb went off while we were gone and now there are food and services for people in our neighborhood!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Back in Bull Island</title>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/usa/back-in-bull-island</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re back! A few days after landing in DC we&amp;#8217;ve returned to my ancestral homeland of Poquoson, Virginia. Here we are visiting the parents, catching up with current events and trying to remember how Sales Tax works. I have to say, for anyone considering doing a Round-the-World trip, it&amp;#8217;s a good idea to leave yourself some &amp;#8220;acclamation&amp;#8221; time on the tale end. We&amp;#8217;ve built in a period where we can visit the friends and family we haven&amp;#8217;t seen all year and that&amp;#8217;s been great, but one added benefit is that it&amp;#8217;s given us time to kind of readjust to life in these United States, much needed time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How have we been spending that time here in Poquoson? Lawn work, small chores around the house, collecting the paperwork to file our taxes. Small stuff that we either had no access to while zipping from city to city or site to site, or just didn&amp;#8217;t have time for. It&amp;#8217;s been a great reintroduction to &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; life here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next month or so we&amp;#8217;ll still be traveling, but at a much slower pace and it will mostly be in places we are familiar with: Virginia, Ohio, DC, Oregon and Texas. So we won&amp;#8217;t be jumping around as much to see things we may never have another chance to see, rather we&amp;#8217;ll be relearning how to approach things that are very familiar and dear to us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of the Internet, it is my fond pleasure to introduce to you today the blog styling of &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sophisticatedalpaca.com/&quot;&gt;sophisticatedalpaca.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog with the funny name is the round the world travel blog of our friends and former neighbors Dennis Campbell and Kristi Barnes. It seems the travel bug is contagious and with no prodding from us, but maybe a little inspiration via this blog (self-congratulatory pat on back) Dennis and Kristi are headed out on their own world trip today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have to say they are doing a REAL world trip &amp;#8211; every populated continent, the whole ticket, no population groups will be spared. And do I have to say &amp;#8220;Easter Island&amp;#8221;?!? They are going to Easter Island! I&amp;#8217;m so jealous, they are going to blow our trip out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if your tired of our stale jokes, our predictable attitude to the locals we meet or our crap photography head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sophisticatedalpaca.com/&quot;&gt;sophisticatedalpaca.com&lt;/a&gt; for bright insights, informative travel writing and witty commentary on the state of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, one of the things we hoped to do with this blog was inspire other folks to get off the couch and get out into the world. We couldn&amp;#8217;t have guessed back in January how close to home that inspiration would find fertile ground. We wish them the best of luck and the safest of travels.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/usa/theyre-coming-to-america-today</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#8217;re back! After the better part of nine months on the road overseas we&amp;#8217;re finally going to be Stateside again. Now here is where a lot of people will get caught up on the fact that we&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8220;Home&amp;#8221; again. While we are indeed back in the States, and we won&amp;#8217;t be having our passports stamped again on this trip &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s not exactly over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re back home, but we&amp;#8217;re still traveling technically. We&amp;#8217;ll fly into Dulles on September 17th, visit both sets of folks for a while, attend a wedding in DC; then fly out to the Oregon and visit some of our West Coast people. After that, we hit Texas and visit more folks. We probably won&amp;#8217;t be &amp;#8220;Back-Back&amp;#8221; at home in Washington, D.C. until some time in November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people will say this is anticlimactic, others will say that we are drawing it out, still some others will say we&amp;#8217;re sell-outs (I&amp;#8217;m not sure why, but there&amp;#8217;s always someone ready to call you a sell out). We say, if you don&amp;#8217;t like it plan your own damn trip. We have a few North American legs still available to us as part of our One World Explorer ticket and we don&amp;#8217;t intend to waste them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we excited to be home? You betcha! Are we ready to unpack our bags, not quite &amp;#8211; besides, we rented our house out for the year so we need to keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So Long Turkey!</title>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/turkey/so-long-turkey</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This entry should really be titled: &amp;#8220;Hoşça kalın Türkiye&amp;#8221;, but it was too hard to resist the chance to use that title. At least we didn&amp;#8217;t title it &amp;#8220;Get Lost Turkey!&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Turkey, this is the last time we will have our Passports stamped out on this trip. The remainder of our time will be spent traveling around the States. So for that reason it&amp;#8217;s bittersweet to leave Istanbul. I think we&amp;#8217;re both ready to see friends and family back home, but it also feels like were getting into the tail end of our trip. I do wish we had more time in Turkey, we really only had the better part of the week in Istanbul and no time at all to explore the rest of the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istanbul has to be one of the most photogenic cities in the world, between the Bosporus, the Mediterranean and the aged Churches and Mosques of the city it&amp;#8217;s certainly up there on our list of favorite places. The locals are very aware of this and there&amp;#8217;s a pride in the city that has many people here wondering why with such a great city they are having such a hard time getting the attention of those in the EU &amp;#8211; but that&amp;#8217;s a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of it&amp;#8217;s attractions Istanbul should be considered a bargain for most travelers, but don&amp;#8217;t expect bargain prices all around &amp;#8211; with the advent of the &amp;#8220;New&amp;#8221; Turkish Lira and the relative weakness of the dollar (Thanks GW), prices for accommodation&amp;#8217;s and food are decidedly more European that Asian &amp;#8211; take plenty of cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we are off to the known world, here we come USA!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It&#8217;s Istanbul Not Constantinople Now</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/turkey/its-istanbul-not-constantinople-now.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/turkey/its-istanbul-not-constantinople-now</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Istanbul is a great city. It straddles the Bosphorus placing half the city in Europe and half in Asia. It&amp;#8217;s an interesting mix of cosmopolitan and traditional is full of rich history and impressive structures left behind by the Greek, Roman and Ottoman empires. Istanbul is one place where it&amp;#8217;s worth the price of admission to see the tourist sights. You could easily spend a full week just visiting sights in Sultanahmet &amp;#8211; an old town area home to the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sofia, Topkapi Palace, the Basilica Cistern and the Grand Bazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, a visit to the Hagia Sofia reflects the religious, cultural and architectural significance of the city. What began as an Orthodox basilica turned mosque turned museum helps to tell the story of Istanbul&amp;#8217;s past. The Hagia Sofia is well known for it&amp;#8217;s Byzantine architecture which held influence in the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Muslim worlds. It served as the Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople and was ransacked during the fourth crusade with relics sent off to the West. During Latin occupation the church was turned into a Roman Catholic Cathedral, but once the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople, the fun times for Christians were over. The Hagia Sofia was immediately converted to a mosque. At independence, the father of the nation Ataturk (fun if pronounced like attaboy) turned it into a museum. Despite the massive scaffolding inside, it&amp;#8217;s a beautiful place to visit and it&amp;#8217;s facade against the blue sky is one of the most stunning in Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair to yourself and Istanbul, you really need to escape the tourist masses in Sultanahmet and check out the culture, food and sights that abound elsewhere. We made time to cruise up the Bosphorus for a glimpse of the Black Sea, stroll across the Galata Bridge watching the fishermen try to make a catch, and take in the well preserved Byzantine mosaics at Chora Church. One activity I am not sure I can recommend is walking the city walls. It sounded like a great adventure and was even detailed in the guidebook we borrowed from our hostel, but it turned out to be a little unpleasant and unrewarding climbing over crumbling stone and broken beer bottles. Not the best restored sight in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting aspects of our visit was that it was the start of Ramadan. Since Istanbul is far more secular than many cities in the Middle East, finding food during the day is not difficult &amp;#8211; especially in the touristy areas. But when you venture away from tourists and into neighborhoods, you have to be more discreet and respectful when quenching your thirst. The festival like atmosphere in the Hippodrome outside of the Blue Mosque after sunset is a great time, but the preparations for Iftar (breaking fast) are not to be missed for people watching. Outdoor cafes start to fill up an hour before sunset, a set menu is placed on all the tables, and whole families stare longingly at their bread basket until the speaker blasts from the Blue Mosque. Let the eating begin!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Muhammad&#8217;s Cats</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/turkey/muhammads-cats.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/turkey/muhammads-cats</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A curious thing about Istanbul is the number of healthy stray cats that freely wander the city. You can easily have a seat in the park near the Blue Mosque and count 20 or more in a matter of minutes. I really can&amp;#8217;t think of another place I have been, including in the US, where stray animals are so well fed and free. When I asked someone what was up with all the cats, she said that Muhammad had a cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a famous story in Muslim theology says that the prophet Muhammad once found his favorite cat, Muezza, sleeping on the sleeve of his robe. Rather than disturbing it, he cut the sleeve off. He supposedly would hold Muezza on his lap while giving sermons in his house and allow the cat to drink from water he used for wudu &amp;#8211; the Islamic act of washing with water prior to ritual prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Islamic tradition, cats are cared for and cherished. They are not to be sold for payment and mistreating a cat would be considered a sin. Having a cat as a pet is ok as long as you provide food, water and adequate roaming time. Apparently, they were serious about this as there&amp;#8217;s a story of a woman who was tortured and put in hell for locking up her little fur ball without food and water. Thankfully we&amp;#8217;ve left out kitty cats in good care this year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ma&#8217;Salama Jordan!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/jordan/masalama-jordan.html"/>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/jordan/masalama-jordan</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of angles I could take with this particular country wrap-up. One is: Jordan &amp;#8211; the only country we&amp;#8217;ve visited to be ruled by a former guest star on Star Trek (It&amp;#8217;s true &amp;#8211; King Abdullah is a huge fan of Star Trek and worked his connection to get an appearance on an episode of Star Trek: Voyager. Which episode? I&amp;#8217;m glad you asked: Episode 36 &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_%28Voyager_episode%29&quot;&gt;Investigations&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Second Angle: Jordan, the tiny country that keeps getting bigger! Jordan borders on some, well, let&amp;#8217;s call them &amp;#8220;tricky&amp;#8221; parts of the world. It has Iraq, Syria, Palestine and Israel for neighbors. When bad things happen in those countries &amp;#8211; have you read the news in the past 60 years? &amp;#8211; people come to Jordan for refuge. As a result it&amp;#8217;s actually a little tricky finding a Jordanian in Jordan. There&amp;#8217;s a constant influx of refugees so it&amp;#8217;s sometimes easier to find an Iraqi, or Palestinian than a real Red, Green and Black Jordanian. Interesting Factoid &amp;#8211; in 1947 Amman, the capitol, had a population of 35,000 people, today it&amp;#8217;s 3 million &amp;#8211; The Middle Easts pain is Jordan&amp;#8217;s gain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Third Angle &amp;#8211; Jordan, It&amp;#8217;s Holy in three religions! It&amp;#8217;s in the Torah, the Bible and the Koran. It&amp;#8217;s geographically small, but full of places referenced in the Good Books of three major religions. Give yourself a week in Jordan and you&amp;#8217;ll give yourself a refresher course in just about everything you need to know about Allah, Yahweh and JC.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Day Out with the Asads</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/jordan/a-day-out-with-the-asads.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/jordan/a-day-out-with-the-asads</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no denying it. The best way to explore a city is with a local. Not only do you get the insider&amp;#8217;s perspective, but you get to see things that you may not seek out on your own. Lucky for us parents of my college friend Faris live in Amman and offered to take us out and about for a day. As it turns out, Laila Asad is quite the accomplished tour guide. She&amp;#8217;ll try talk your way into the closed Royal Automobile Museum, convince the security guard that tells you not to take a picture of King Hussein&amp;#8217;s mosque that he&amp;#8217;s wrong and encourage you to take it anyway, and negotiate your way out of a sticky situation with the British Embassy after you&amp;#8217;ve snapped a few scenic shots out front of their fortress on September 11th. Oops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seriously, a day out with the Asads is not to be missed. After a divine lunch of vegetarian mezze at a local restaurant, we saw and learned quite a bit about Amman. You see, Amman used to be a relatively small town, but over the last 50 years it&amp;#8217;s absorbed huge numbers of immigrants and refugees from it&amp;#8217;s neighboring countries &amp;#8211; particularly during times of conflict &amp;#8211; like say, now. And it&amp;#8217;s not poor refugees. The Kuwaitis and Iraqis who&amp;#8217;ve made their way to Amman our fueling major economic growth and development in West Amman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Amman is full of massive newly built villas, fancy shopping malls and possibly the largest Starbucks in the world. The contrast between the old downtown area and newer areas like Abdoun in West Amman are drastic. Downtown women, at a minimum, wear a hejab that covers their head, markets bustle with people buying fresh produce and little eateries serve up amazing, cheap hummus and falafel. In Abdoun, you can drink a pricey cappuccino, eat any kind of food and watch young couples, who could very well be from the US, flirt and socialize with one another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed the only thing that reminds you you&amp;#8217;re not in the west while touring West Amman is the security you pass through to walk into a restaurant or mall. Don&amp;#8217;t forget to pop that trunk before you park your car in the garage!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Life on the Kings Highway</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/jordan/life-on-the-kings-highway.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/jordan/life-on-the-kings-highway</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to get from Petra to Amman: the fast way is to take the Desert Highway, a name that leaves little to the imagination, the other is the Kings Highway. The King’s Highway was a major trade route in the ancient Mid-East. It begins in Egypt crosses the Sinai Peninsula then turns north, stretching to Damascus before forking to either Bagdhad or Anatolia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kings Highway is mentioned in the Bible in the book of Numbers chapter 20 verses 17-21:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 Please let us pass through your country. We will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from wells; we will go along the King&amp;#8217;s Highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.&amp;#39;&amp;#8221;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18 Then Edom said to him, &amp;#8220;You shall not pass through my land, lest I come out against you with the sword.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;
19 So the children of Israel said to him, &amp;#8220;We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, nothing more.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;
20 Then he said,&amp;#8221;You shall not pass through.&amp;#8221; So Edom came out against them with many men and with a strong hand.&lt;br&gt;
21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, we were simply going to take the six dollar two hour bus straight to Amman, but we were charmed into taking the Kings Highway route by our driver in Petra. While Jordan is not a big country it is seriously packed with sites of historical significance, and most of those are on or near the Kings Highway. Our Driver offered to take us on a one day whirlwind tour of the Highway, and through a combination of fatigue, vague interest and a sudden aversion to public transportation &amp;#8211; we agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop was an old Crusader castle &amp;#8211; Shobak Castle &amp;#8211; in addition to reclaiming Holy sites for Christendom it seems the Crusaders were also interested in controlling this barren hilltop for &amp;#8230;well for money. It&amp;#8217;s situated at a strategically important site on the Highway. It&amp;#8217;s also located near what is thought to be the site of the biblical Las Vegas &amp;#8211; Sodom, of Sodom and Gomorrah fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next destination was the Dana Village, a village on the edge of the Wadi Dana Reserve, one of Jordans largest protected natural areas. Um, okay &amp;#8211; I didn&amp;#8217;t hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop &amp;#8211; Karak Castle &amp;#8211; Karak is kind of the capitol of Southern Jordan. Also a big stop over for Crusaders and pretty much every conquering army over the last few thousand years. The Castle itself is remarkably well preserved and offers impressive views of the Dead Sea. There is also a sizable Christian community still in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next &amp;#8211; The Dead Sea. The lowest point on the planet, hot, humid and &amp;#8230;hot. Our driver talked us into taking a dip in that nasty water. Normal sea water is 3 to 4 percent salt. The Dead Sea is 30 percent salt. The only thing that lives in it are two types of bacteria &amp;#8211; let&amp;#8217;s get in it! There are a number of extremely high end resorts on this nasty collection of H2O, I have no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dead Sea was quickly followed by &amp;#8211; Hammamat Ma&amp;#8217;in (Hot Springs). Basically a tea stop for our driver, no comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two stops in our quickly tour was arguably the most important in Jordan &amp;#8211; Mount Nebo. This is the site where it is believed that Moses saw the Promised Land of Israel and died. It&amp;#8217;s been a pilgrimage site for Jews, Christians and Muslims for oh, a few thousand years. Talk about beating a well worn path! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to Madaba &amp;#8211; the home of the ancient tradition of mosaic craftsmanship in Jordan. Also a stopover for Medieval Pilgrims on their way to Mt. Nebo the highlight of this village is an 900 year old map of the Holy Land and Near East. It was recently rediscovered in the floor of a Church during renovations. It was literally hidden right under the feet of worshippers for the last several hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so eight hours later we arrive in Amman. It was a bit of a breakneck pace, but considering our limited time in Jordan, it was probably worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Petra Rocks!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/jordan/petra-rocks.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/jordan/petra-rocks</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pun intended! There&amp;#8217;s no doubt about it. Petra is an amazing place. Definitely among the most amazing places on our trip. When you think of Petra, you may envision Harrison Ford and Sean Connery on horse back emerging from a narrow canyon to see the magnificent Treasury. The Treasury is certainly one of the most famous buildings in Petra, but there are many, many more making up an entire city of colorfully carved facades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its hey day thousands of years ago, Petra was described as a cosmopolitan city full of beautiful buildings, gardens and villas. The Nabateans had moved from their nomadic cave dwelling culture to a wealthy and powerful kingdom popular on the early trade routes. But nothing last forever, and Petra eventually fell into disrepair only to be rediscovered by a Swiss explorer in the early 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Petra is a World Heritage site and most recently has been named by popular vote to the New Seven Wonders of the World. It has earned the titles. We spent two days exploring the city. Our legs were exhausted and our shoes full of sand, but the trip there merits long days of walking. The initial walk down the Siq &amp;#8211; a naturally formed gorge &amp;#8211; is stunning. All the time you are anticipating your first sighting of the Treasury. It doesn&amp;#8217;t disappoint. The camels, though touristy, do add ambience. And an odd smell. Provided you are in half decent shape, you&amp;#8217;d be a fool to not hike up to the High Place of Sacrifice to take in the views over the whole area. We opted to take an alternate route down the back side of the jebel (mountain) and were rewarded with sites that few tourists venture to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our second day we thought we&amp;#8217;d change it up a bit and took the &amp;#8220;path less travelled&amp;#8221; into the city. That&amp;#8217;s an understatement. When your guidebook says it&amp;#8217;s too dangerous to follow a path during the rainy season, I guess that should be an indication that it might get a little hairy. Especially when it&amp;#8217;s a narrow gorge prone to flash flooding and everything that rushing water leaves behind during the dry season. Lucky for us, there wasn&amp;#8217;t a threat of rain in the sky. The hike turned out to be a fun adventure of scrambling over boulders and through narrow canyon passages. When we popped out the other side, we came across an excited German tourist who commented that this was better than any of the canyons he&amp;#8217;d explored in Utah. Not sure about that, but it was pretty cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the Monastery was a clear favorite. Perched on top of a mountain with a door the size of a house, it&amp;#8217;s an awe inspiring sight. Especially after you&amp;#8217;ve made the sweaty hike up to it. Though it&amp;#8217;s not as ornate as the Treasury, it&amp;#8217;s scale and location make it a highlight of Petra. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if Petra is one of those places that you&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to visit, then go! Come on. Even Delroy Lindo is doing it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Looking for the Promised Land</title>

        <updated>2007-09-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/jordan/looking-for-the-promised-land</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,&lt;br&gt;
8 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.&lt;br&gt;
9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.&lt;br&gt;
10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?&lt;br&gt;
11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.&lt;br&gt;
12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.&lt;br&gt;
Numbers 20:11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a biblical site junkie, you should think about a visit to Jordan. Once you&amp;#8217;re Petra-d out, you can take in a few local biblically referenced sights compliments of Moses trek through the area with the Israelites en route to the Promised Land. Though not universally accepted as the true site, you can see the rock that Moses struck and the accompanying spring. I bet that water was looking pretty good after 40 years in the desert! Don&amp;#8217;t get too excited though. Today the spring appears to be a popular source of water for car washing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from atop one of the many mountains in Petra you can see Jebel Haroun, Aaron&amp;#8217;s mountain, where a white shrine marks the alleged location of his burial &amp;#8211; a popular pilgrimage site for Christians, Jews and Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is That Who I Think It Is?</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/england/is-that-who-i-think-it-is.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/england/is-that-who-i-think-it-is</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It`s always kind of fun to see famous people, even when they`re not that interesting. I`m not sure why. I can remember acting like a groupie at a rock concert when a I saw Dukakis at a rally back in high school. Yes, that Dukakis. And yes, I must have been an odd girl. Still, it`s fun to see personalities in real life and we`ve spotted a string of &amp;#8220;B&amp;#8221; list celebs in the last week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First it was Jamie Oliver. You know the young Brit chef who is kind of cute but not really. We stumbled onto his book signing in Borough Market on our last day ın London. Since the book was bigger than our backpacks, we passed on the signing, but stood around long enough to watch him flirt with his fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next sighting came later that day as we sat down at a restaurant in Heathrow Airport. I looked over and saw a clean cut, middle age guy in sensible brown shoes, khaki pants, white shirt, red tie and blue blazer. Kind of looks like a politician. Hey, that`s Kucinich. Dave of course didn`t believe me, and since his back was turned he couldn`t catch a good glimpse of him. Dave taunted me to go over and talk to him, but what would I say? &amp;#8220;Hey there Mr. Kucinich. I have a lot of respect for you, but never vote for you for Presıdent.&amp;#8221; Or Dave`s suggestion was, &amp;#8220;Hey there. So what`s it like to meet Hillary?&amp;#8221; So while we sat around thinking of inappropriate things to say to him, all the while arguing if it was really him at all, I think my continous staring probably unnerved him. He took his food to go and bolted for the gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last sighting came as we were kicking back in the shade just outside the ticket gate at Petra. In the distance we saw a good looking black man talking with one of the guards from the gate &amp;#8211; clearly getting, or trying to get, some kind of special treatment. Hmm. Not tall enough and not enough bling to be an NBA player. As he walked past us to the gate office, Dave and I both caught a good glimpse of him. Hey, I`ve seen that guy in something. He was very striking, and definitely ignoring the nosy onlookers. Somehow Dave came up with the name Delroy Lindo. I`d never heard of him, but I certainly recognized this guy. Again, it just didn`t seem right to walk up to him and say &amp;#8220;I know I`ve seen you in movies but who are you?&amp;#8221; Or better yet, &amp;#8220;So what`s it like to meet Jet Li?&amp;#8221; So we let him go in peace, but if he was looking to keep a low profile maybe he should have left his driver and SUV at the gate and taken a donkey like all the other tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>See You Later UK!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/england/see-you-later-uk.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/england/see-you-later-uk</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our time in the UK was short, shorter than anywhere on the trip yet. You say &amp;#8211; the UK has a lot to offer, the transportation system is excellent, why not stay longer? A few reasons: we&amp;#8217;ve both been there before, we live on the US East Coast and flights to London are relatively cheap so we will probably go again, and the idea behind this trip was to go places that were a little less accessible to us for whatever reason &amp;#8211; distant location, long flight time, crap internal transportation systems. The UK doesn&amp;#8217;t fit into any of those categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told we probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t have gone to the UK at all had our One World Explorer tickets not demanded we pass through Heathrow to get from Africa to any location in North America. Okay, on second thought the trip wouldn&amp;#8217;t really have been complete for one of us (me) had we not been able to catch a game at &lt;a href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=177&quot;&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt;. But for the reasons above the UK wasn&amp;#8217;t on our &amp;#8220;Must See&amp;#8221; list for this trip (plus, have you seen the exchange rates lately? Help a brother out Central Banking System).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;m really glad we did. It was a little bit like being back in the states for a few days (sorry if that offends any British readers, but bear with me), we got to converse in English with locals who use that as their first language, meet a long lost family member, got to see a rock show (&lt;a href=&quot;www.thepolyphonicspree.com/&quot;&gt;the Polyphonic Spree&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Astoria&quot;&gt;the Astoria&lt;/a&gt; -narrowly missed the &lt;a href=&quot;www.beastieboys.com/&quot;&gt;Beastie Boys&lt;/a&gt; again) and attend a professional sporting event. All this and the extra bonus of being able to drink the tap water and eat all the leafy greens our hearts desired &amp;#8211; haven&amp;#8217;t done that since mid-March! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all good things, we will probably see our English Cousins sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>England Notes for Budget Travelers</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/england/england-notes-for-budget-travelers.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/england/england-notes-for-budget-travelers</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok. Budget is a bit of a misnomer. Let`s refer to it as a bleeding. The U.K. is an expensive place to visit when you`re on vacation and headed back to work and a paycheck next Friday. Coming from months in Asia, it was just painful to watch the pounds pour out of our wallet. In one week, we spent almost as much money as we did in two months of travel in India. Ok. So maybe this is not a fair comparison, but still. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said in &lt;a title=&quot;ouch!&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=121&quot;&gt;Damn that Dollar&lt;/a&gt;, the prices are high and the exchange rate is a killer. So here are a few tips if you would like to make an attempt at budget travel ın England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Transport&lt;/u&gt; can be expensive. Buses tend to be cheaper than the train for getting around the country, but if you`re traveling mid week and buy tickets in advance, you can get a good deal on the train. Getting around Central London is pretty easy on foot. For longer journeys around town or tired feet, the Tube is pleasant but pricey. If you are planning to do a few things outside the central area, it`s best to buy a Travel Card and take advantage of all day riding. Personally, I prefer the bus. A day pass is less than a return fare and much less than the Tube and you get the pleasure of riding around town on the double decker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lodging&lt;/u&gt; is a source of much pain. Hostels are plentiful throughout the U.K. but the prices are often more than you would pay for a decent hotel some places in the U.S and many are complete crap. In Liverpool our options were slim since much of the accomodation was already booked. We opted for the backpacker stalwart known as the Embassie. It`s the cheapest place in town, but only has dorm rooms. So we squeezed in with several others and tolerated the comings and goings of our roommates, one little shared bath and one long night of very loud snoring. You know it`s bad when Dave gets up, shakes a stranger`s bed and tells him to roll over. All this luxury cost us about $60 US a night. In London, we stayed at the massive Generator (better when pronounced with Schwarzenegger accent). The Generator is a full service mega hostel. It`s full of people, but is in a good location, clean, well serviced and provides free breakfast and good, cheap dinners, plus a free drink on arrival. A private room with bunk beds (we`ve gotten used to this), a sink and shared bath ran about $81 US a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Food&lt;/u&gt; runs the gamut in England. You can find all types and at all prices. Many restaurants offer good lunch deals, and there are plenty of cheap and tasty ethnic restaurants around town. A budget meal for the two of us was probably about $15 US &amp;#8211; and it doesn`t get much cheaper than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Touristy Stuff&lt;/u&gt; is often free, though some entrance fees are a little pricey. We had considered visiting Buckingham Palace &amp;#8211; which has additional private residences open this month &amp;#8211; but tickets would have been around $60 per person. This was money better spent on LFC tickets &amp;#8211; which were roughly the same price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We`ve both been to England before, and will definitely return again, but with more cash and a paycheck waiting in the bank at home.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After close calls with my Cousin &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jawolf.com/samf/&quot;&gt;Sam Forrest&lt;/a&gt; in both New Zealand and Shanghai, we are happy to say we have successfully made contact with my cousin Joe Bateman in London. Actually, he lives ın Watford, but he was nice enough to meet up with us in Central London and show us the sights. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen Joe in probably 20 years, but we after quickly comparing notes on the last two decades he got down to his bread and butter showing us the town. He makes a good tour guide and showed us the Tower of London, The Tower Bridge, the Southbank of the Thames, Llyods of London, Big Ben and Parliament, Number 10 Downing Street and Trafalger Square. He tried to take us into the National Gallery, but if we had a dime for every museum we went into on this trip we could retire for life &amp;#8211; so we had to politely decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He certainly has a career as a tour guide to fall back on, but he seems to be doing well for himself in the UK &amp;#8211; he qualifies for a passport next year and he seems very settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2000 a few friends and myself did a &amp;#8220;football&amp;#8221; tour of the UK, we booked everything ourselves and got tickets to maybe six different games at different clubs, it was a great time and pretty easy to set up &amp;#8211; those days are gone. Since then clubs have thrown up huge barriers to prevent scalping &amp;#8211; you have to be a season ticket holder, a member of the &amp;#8220;supporters&amp;#8221; club or have a documented history of ticket purchases to get into a game &amp;#8211; while this may prevent scalpers from getting tickets, one unfortunate consequence is that if you are a casual fan you&amp;#8217;re last in line, and generally that means you&amp;#8217;re locked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happened top us. The game sold out weeks in advance, even through the opponents (Derby County) are the English soccer equivalents of the LA Clippers. We looked high and low, but there was nothing available. We went to Liverpool anyway, looking for a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re looking for a miracle the best place to start is with a priest right? Enter Father Andrew Small &amp;#8211; a former coworker of LeeAnne`s and whose hometown is Liverpool. A week or so before we arrived she mailed him to get his recommendations on what to do in town (beyond soccer). Father Andrew, knowing that I was a Liverpool fan, asked if we were going to a game. LeeAnne reported the sad news &amp;#8211; we didn&amp;#8217;t have tickets and it looked like we wouldn&amp;#8217;t find any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened next is what people in the movie industry call a &amp;#8220;Reveal&amp;#8221;: Father Andrew wrote back saying that his uncle &amp;#8211; one &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Campbell_%28footballer_born_1937%29&quot;&gt;Bobby Campbell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; in fact use to play for Liverpool back in the day &amp;#8211; before being the manager at Fulham and Chelsea &amp;#8211; and he might be able to get us tickets. Not just normal tickets mind you &amp;#8211; as a former player not only can he conjure tickets out of the air at the last minute he can also get &amp;#8220;uber-tickets&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; tickets for seats with the &amp;#8220;Old Boys&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; former Liverpool players. Well, that was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many hands make easy work. As we arrived ın Liverpool an ocean away in Washington Father Andrew was calling his Mum Alice in Liverpool, who was then calling her brother Bobby in London, who was calling his connections at the box office at Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His contact at Liverpool FC turns out to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hall&quot;&gt;Brian Hall&lt;/a&gt;, (who set up the winning goal in Liverpools 1974 FA Cup win over Newcastle United). Who found a pair of seats for us and had his assistant drop off the tickets at Alice Small`s house, she was then was kind enough to meet us downtown for a cup of tea &amp;#8211; lovely woman. All of this happened within 48 hours before the game, we (Okay, I) went from the deepest despair to the happiest glee, and I have many people to thank for it. We still aren&amp;#8217;t sure how to repay everyone, someone suggested we name our first male child after Father Andrew, but I think he would be teased horribly if his first name was &amp;#8220;Father&amp;#8221; don&amp;#8217;t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;In the Game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any game at Anfield would have been great &amp;#8211; there is a terrific atmosphere there &amp;#8211; but this game was remarkable if I do say so. Not just because of the scoreline &amp;#8211; a 6-0 win for Liverpool &amp;#8211; and not just because it was my first &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; Liverpool game, but with the win Liverpool went to the top of the League for the first tıme in over five years! Derby Co. has two Amerıcan players on the roster &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Lewis_(soccer)&quot;&gt;Eddie Lewis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Feilhaber&quot;&gt;Benny Feilhaber&lt;/a&gt;, and luckily they were spared the mauling that the rest of their team took. Derby never stood a chance really, but I&amp;#8217;ll say this &amp;#8211; their fans were great, and very vocal throughout the match. They had the whole stadium in tears with chants of &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ll win 7-6&amp;#8243; in the closing moments of the match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the seats! Nothing to complain about here the tickets themselves said &amp;#8220;Former Player&amp;#8221; on them and we were sitting behind former Liverpool Captain &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Yeats&quot;&gt;Ron Yeats&lt;/a&gt;, and fellow great &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Strong&quot;&gt;Geoff Strong&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; I was too petrified to talk to them, much less get my picture taken with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left the match everyone was deservedly excited with our team looking good and on top of the table. But an old fan who has obviously seen more that we have walked out of the stadium sighed and said to himself &amp;#8220;Ah, delusions of grandeur again&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, a funny thing happened on the way home from the soccer match&amp;#8230; Back in 2000 when we were in Liverpool we went to an FA Cup match between Everton and Tranmere, we took the bus up to the stadium, but after the match the buses were so full we ended up walking the 5km back into the city, and this time almost exactly the same thing happened &amp;#8211; only this time I knew where I was going, no one twisted their ankle and there were no kids throwing rocks at us shouting &amp;#8220;Go Back to Tranmere!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Damn that Dollar!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/england/damn-that-dollar.html"/>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/england/damn-that-dollar</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;England is great and London is possibly one of the greatest cities in the world. There are cool things to do, funky clothes to buy, good shows to see, and yummy food to eat (ethinic food of course). Too bad it costs so damn much to do any of it when you&amp;#8217;re coming with US dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really simple to figure out the cost in dollars when preparing to make a purchase. Just multiply by two. Most things cost in British pounds about what you would pay in a major city in the U.S. The problem is that with the crap exchange rate, you basically pay double what you would at home for just about everything. Makes me sad. Even the Charity Shop thrift store is too pricey for us. Just taking the Tube, London&amp;#8217;s Metro, a stop or two will set you back $4. Ouch. Lucky for us we enjoy walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part we&amp;#8217;ve gotten over it and are making the most of our time in the UK. Lots of museums are free, though we haven&amp;#8217;t really spent any time in them, and there are interesting neighborhoods and markets to explore. We&amp;#8217;ve put our precious quid (British slang for the pound) to good use for The Polyphonic Spree at the Astoria and of course the beloved Liverpool Football Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Football and music. Two things that clearly merit the expenditure. It is England after all!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chillin&#8217; in the &#8216;Pool</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/england/chillin-in-the-pool.html"/>
        <updated>2007-09-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/england/chillin-in-the-pool</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We ventured to Liverpool for very obvious reasons, but still without the promise of tickets to see the boys in red at Anfield. Luckily the tickets worked out, but I&amp;#8217;ll let the footy fan tell his tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not a football (soccer) fan, chances are you&amp;#8217;ve heard of Liverpool thanks to the Fab Four. Beatlemania has definitely drawn more than a few tourists to Liverpool. You can participate in any number of tours. We skipped the Beatles Story, among others, and instead took a stroll down Matthew St to see the sight of the Cavern Club. The original club closed with the construction of the underground rail in the 70s, but a new Cavern is alive and thumpin&amp;#8217; across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And believe it or not, there is more to the &amp;#8216;pool of life than LFC and Beatlemania. As we strolled around town on our first day &amp;#8211; trying to walk off the groggies after a sleepless flight from South Africa &amp;#8211; we stumbled on to Late at Tate. The Tate ıs one of the well known Tate museums and wanderıng into it on our first night in town was a pleasant surprise. We took in the Centre of the Creative Universe &amp;#8216;Liverpool&amp;#8217; and the Avant Garde exhibit. True, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but as the exhibit revealed, Liverpool has an interesting history of experimental and conceptual art as well as some great music. Our night at Late at Tate was topped off with a free local brew and tunes spun by Will Sergeant of Echo and the Bunnymen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool is also full of interesting neo classical architecture and home to the the UK’s largest Anglican Cathedral which boasts the world’s highest and heaviest peal of bells in addition to the the world’s highest and widest Gothic arches. Appropriately enough, just down Hope St is it&amp;#8217;s Catholic brother, the Metropolitan Cathedral Christ the King. This building I would not count among the architectural wonders of Liverpool. It is fondly referred to as &amp;#8220;Paddy&amp;#8217;s Wigwam&amp;#8221; due to its &amp;#8220;interesting&amp;#8221; style and the fact that many Irish once worshipped there. I have to say that it looks like an architectural mistake of the 80s, but in reality it was built in the 60s and surprisingly, had no predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good old Liverpool proved to be well worth the visit!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So Long Southern Africa!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/so-long-southern-africa.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/so-long-southern-africa</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I feel like we owe Africa another trip. Five weeks here just doesn&amp;#8217;t do this wonder corner of the world justice. We&amp;#8217;ve had a chance to pop around a bit in Southern Africa, but I feel like we just peeped through a keyhole and the place has a lot more to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Southern Africa is a land of great countryside and crappy cities. That&amp;#8217;s really true through out the world, but everything here seems to be amplified. The countryside is greater and the cities are much worse (Cape Town excluded) than almost everywhere else we&amp;#8217;ve visited. And in terms of wildlife, S. Africa has the world beat, there&amp;#8217;s an amazing diversity of things to see here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, it&amp;#8217;s one of the few places we&amp;#8217;ve traveled so far where the American Dollar is still strong! Thank goodness the currencies of Southern Africa are falling in value faster than the dollar, because you&amp;#8217;ll need them all. Because transportation is so spotty and semi functional in this part of the world to get around you&amp;#8217;ll either need to hire a car and drive yourself around or book yourself on a package tour &amp;#8211; and neither option is cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel in Southern Africa is one of the parts of the trip I have to admit I wasn&amp;#8217;t super excited about, but it&amp;#8217;s really exceeded all of my expectations, and I have to recommend you look into it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wild Wild Windhoek</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/namibia/wild-wild-windhoek.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/namibia/wild-wild-windhoek</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Windhoek is the medium size capitol of a very small country, &amp;#8211; Namibia only has 1.2 million residents &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s also Namibia&amp;#8217;s financial and transportation center. If you are coming to Namibia, at some point you will pass through Windhoek. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namibia was once a German colony and while it hasn&amp;#8217;t been directly connected to Germany since the first World War, there are a surprising number of German speakers here. As a white person walking the streets we became use to people addressing us with &amp;#8220;Gutentag&amp;#8221; rather than &amp;#8220;Hello&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One welcome example of the German influence is the surprising number and quality of German bakeries in town. There are some high quality pretzels in this town!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not a bad experience, it&amp;#8217;s a very walkable city, and crime isn&amp;#8217;t that bad here. But, chances are slim you came all the way to Namibia to visit Windhoek. The real sights of Namibia are out in the countryside, go to Etosha or Fish River Canyon or the Dunes as soon as you can. Windhoek is best used as a stopover to these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that may stick out is the rather surprising tendency to name major streets after dictators &amp;#8211; for example: the middle of town is the intersection of Robert Mugabe Avenue with Fidel Castro Street. Other than that it&amp;#8217;s a pretty normal medium sized African town.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Southern Tour of Namibia</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/namibia/the-southern-tour-of-namibia.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/namibia/the-southern-tour-of-namibia</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First things first. No, we didn&amp;#8217;t come to Namibia because Brad and Angelina did. No, we didn&amp;#8217;t see them. No, we didn&amp;#8217;t even meet anyone who mentioned them. We were, however, shown the filming location of J Lo&amp;#8217;s movie, The Cell, which of course we haven&amp;#8217;t seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namibia is a fairly big, relatively unpopulated country with interesting sights spread all over. Given a somewhat limited time frame, the two places we really wanted to visit were Etosha National Park in the north and the Sossusvlei Dunes in the south. Though you can rent a car and drive safely on sealed roads through much of the country, we knew we&amp;#8217;d want to head off the beaten path at some point. So instead we opted for an organized tour where changing the tire or seeking mechanical help in the middle of nowhere is someone else&amp;#8217;s problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since of course we were trying to organize something at the last minute, out options were limited. We landed ourselves on &lt;a title=&quot;Wild Dog Safari&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wilddog-safaris.com/&quot;&gt;Wild Dog Safari&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; 7 Day Southern Swing. We&amp;#8217;d be skipping Etosha NP, but get to visit the dunes and as a bonus take in Fish River Canyon &amp;#8211; the second largest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#8217;ve been on the road doing our own thing for about 8 months now, you can imagine that being herded and structured 24/7 is not really our style. Nor is riding cramped in a safari vehicle for way too many hours each day watching Kelso and Jackie snog the day away. Seriously, it was Seinfeld&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;schmoopie&amp;#8221; meets That 70s Show. But once you get past the handful of &amp;#8220;characters&amp;#8221; in the group, the trip was really quite nice. And luckily we had several really fun and interesting folks along for the ride making the week even more memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The undeniable highlight of the trip was climbing the sand dunes at sunset. Just as you think you&amp;#8217;ve reached the top, you see more dunes cresting again in the distance. The slog up and over what seems to be endless dunes, is absolutely worth it. And with the glow of the late day sun illuminating the dunes, it&amp;#8217;s just beautiful. Other highlights of our southern tour were seeing quiver trees, which are actually not trees but aloe plants run amok, hearing cultural music of the Nama people, taking a stroll along the rim of the Fish River Canyon, watching the sunset over the Orange River, and exploring the diamond mining ghost town of Kolmanskoop, where half of the buildings are filled to the roof with sand (and a sign let&amp;#8217;s you know that Diamond theft hurst us all&amp;#8230;in case you were wondering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unanticipated highlight of the trip, though I doubt uncommon, was getting to pack up camp in the middle of a sandstorm so we could shove off to calmer parts where you don&amp;#8217;t brush your teeth with sand. Ok, well it wasn&amp;#8217;t really a highlight, but it did make things even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Black and White and Southern African All Over</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/black-and-white-and-southern-african-all-over.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/black-and-white-and-southern-african-all-over</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the part of the blog where I get us in trouble. We&amp;#8217;ve only been here five weeks or so, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to leave here without making a comment about the racial tension in this part of the world, and it comes from both directions. From the white Zimbabwean who corrected us by saying that he was &amp;#8220;Rhodesian&amp;#8221;, to the Black South African who informed us that when watching a soccer match he always pulled for the team with more Blacks (bonus points if they were from Africa) it&amp;#8217;s impossible to escape how much things are defined by skin here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Call Me Whitey&amp;#8230;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I have never met a group of people as humorless and vaguely unfriendly at all times as white Southern Africans. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s a result of being a ruling minority for over a hundred years, maybe it&amp;#8217;s just the German blood coming out, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to get a response from many of them even when you (try) to look them in the eye and wish them a good day &amp;#8211; and I&amp;#8217;m white like them! Somehow this hasn&amp;#8217;t effected our (generally) good opinion of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#8217;re constantly surprised at how many whites we see here. Everywhere we go, there they are: Namibia &amp;#8211; full of Germans, Zambia and Zimbabwe &amp;#8211; full of English and Dutch, South Africa &amp;#8211; All of the above and a huge number of Portuguese for good measure. Many are members of old families that have been here for generations, and they consider themselves Africans, despite whatever problems they face this is their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for how long will they be there? It&amp;#8217;s apparent that there&amp;#8217;s white flight, but one person we spoke to was taking it to the next level. One of our drivers in Kruger was a white Namibian living and working in South Africa. When we spoke to him about the future he shocked us by pointing at the back of his hand and saying &amp;#8220;This isn&amp;#8217;t a racist statement, but I&amp;#8217;m just the wrong color for this continent.&amp;#8221; Now, that is a racist statement, but what he said next was even more shocking to me. He was living and working in South Africa just long enough to qualify for a South African passport, then he was picking up the family and moving to Australia. It&amp;#8217;s much easier to immigrate to Australia from S. Africa than Namibia as S.A. is a member of the British Commonwealth like Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Cult of Robert Mugabe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as shocking is how Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe&amp;#8217;s leader, is held on high among African governments. Despite the fact that the country is a shambles and it&amp;#8217;s estimated that 1/4 of the population has fled into neighboring countries illegally there are a surprising number of monuments to him around Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Johannesburg, where there are over a million Zimbabwean refugees, the main square in downtown is named after him. It&amp;#8217;s not uncommon to look for an address on &amp;#8220;Robert Mugabe Street&amp;#8221; either. It seems that while most people will admit that he&amp;#8217;s a bastard and not helping his country or his people he is &amp;#8220;Their&amp;#8221; bastard, and that is preferable to the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not trying to talk anyone out of coming here, far from it. Many of these issues are the same that we encounter in the US, but here unlike the US people are much more open about their prejudices and much more determined to stick to their guns. It&amp;#8217;s awful and interesting and familiar all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chillin&#8217; in Cape Town</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/chillin-in-cape-town.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/chillin-in-cape-town</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cape Town is easily the best city we&amp;#8217;ve visited in Africa, by far, LeeAnne is even claiming it&amp;#8217;s her favorite city on the whole trip (but I&amp;#8217;m not ready to go that far yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why all the enthusiasm? Well, this place looks great (especially since we&amp;#8217;re coming from Johannesburg), for one &amp;#8211; you can walk the streets (how novel!), you can even walk many streets after sunset (amazing!) and most implausibly, there are things to do here! Within a block of our hostel on Long Street there is a Vegetarian restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, a bar that shows EPL soccer, an internet cafe a movie theater and laundromat. Have we arrived or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are just the creature comforts, the setting is also top shelf &amp;#8211; Table Mountain sits behind the city and the Ocean is in front. The temperature is temperate and it even rains here &amp;#8211; take that Jo&amp;#8217;Berg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city is centered around the harbor area, which has been made a bit too sanitized by construction of a series of malls (think Fishermans Warf in San Francisco), it&amp;#8217;s still beautiful. You can take the San Francisco analogy a bit farther by taking a ferry from the harbor out to Robben Island &amp;#8211; South Africa&amp;#8217;s version of Alcatraz. Nelson Mandela was imprisoned here for much of his 27 years behind bars, now (like Alcatraz) it&amp;#8217;s been converted into a tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many highlights here is a hike up Table Mountain. It stands some 2000 meters above the city streets below, so you can guess the view from the top is special. You&amp;#8217;ll need to get good weather to really enjoy it though. And if you&amp;#8217;re a bit tired from the hike up, luckily you can take a Cable Car down. It&amp;#8217;s probably the best Cable Car you&amp;#8217;ll ever ride, to take full advantage of the scenery the car spins 360 degrees around as you descend to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Two Oceans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big natural attractions outside of Cape Town is the Cape of Good Hope, where the Indian and Atlantic oceans meet. It&amp;#8217;s protected as a national park and there are lots of great hiking tracks around the Cape area. LeeAnne and I rented a car for the day and drove down for a little sightseeing and hiking. I wish we&amp;#8217;d had more time, if we ever come back it&amp;#8217;d be great to spend a few days there hiking and camping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Whales, Why&amp;#8217;d It Have to Be Whales?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Whale season in Cape Town and on our day trip we kept our eyes open for the elusive buggers, but we didn&amp;#8217;t spot any. We did have more luck seeing African Penguins at the hatchery in Simionstown. It&amp;#8217;s also Penguin hatching season and we saw literally hundreds of the cute little buggers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I have to say we really loved Cape Town, and would recommend it to anyone considering spending time in SA. It&amp;#8217;s the best place here by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/crazy-taxi-south-africa-edition</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why did we do it? We had little choice. Was there no other option? No, there wasn&amp;#8217;t. These are only a few of the questions we found ourselves asking one another as we took our first African &amp;#8220;Public Taxi&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves. Let&amp;#8217;s start at the beginning: LeeAnne and I realized that our passports where slowly filling up. In fact, we probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t have enough room for all the immigration stamps we&amp;#8217;d get before returning to the states. The solution seemed easy enough &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;d go to the US Consulate in Cape Town and have them add extra pages, it&amp;#8217;s a free service and it take 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the issue is the location of the consulate. Despite all the empty office space downtown the US Consulate is located way, way, way out in the suburbs, past the train lines. We&amp;#8217;d have to take a train, then a cab to get out there. Okay, no problem &amp;#8211; we hop on a train and head out to &amp;#8220;Retreat Station&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, downtown there are cabs and buses flying left and right. Not so out in Retreat. Here there are only &amp;#8220;Public Taxi&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;. So what is a Public Taxi? Public Taxi&amp;#8217;s fill the void between Cabs and Buses, they&amp;#8217;re independently operated like cabs, but carry a lot of people like buses. And in many African cities where public transportation is sparse they are the only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s how it works: The Taxi&amp;#8217;s are really vans converted to carry as many people as possible. Imagine 15 to 18 people in a minivan. They run set routes like buses, so don&amp;#8217;t expect to get in, tell them where you want to go and have them drop you off there like a cab. You&amp;#8217;ll have to whistle or yelp to get the drivers attention when you see where you want to get off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the train station you go to the taxi stand and ask someone which taxi will take you to a certain part of town. From there you load up and wait for the van to fill up, the driver won&amp;#8217;t leave until he&amp;#8217;s full. When you&amp;#8217;re off on the road, keep an eye out for your destination (hard to do when it&amp;#8217;s your first time in town), as the driver is not looking out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it out to the embassy in something like a timely manner, had our pages added in nothing flat and then had to figure out how to get back into town. We were very open to non Public Taxi options so we consulted the good ladies at the Consulates main gate. &amp;#8220;Where&amp;#8217;s your car?&amp;#8221; was their first question. They then gaped at us in disbelief as we explained we took a public taxi out &amp;#8211; it seems there aren&amp;#8217;t a lot of white tourists taking Public Taxi&amp;#8217;s to the Consulate these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking a moment to grasp what we said they gave us directions to the nearest public taxi pick-up, told us not to pay more that 4.50 Rand and wished us the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#8217;m glad we did it. It&amp;#8217;s good to see how normal folks get around when you travel, but I&amp;#8217;m glad we don&amp;#8217;t have to go out to the Consulate again. Thanks Crazy Taxi.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Viewing Game &#8211; Krueger National Park</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/the-viewing-game-krueger-national-park.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/the-viewing-game-krueger-national-park</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a little taste of wildlife viewing in Zimbabwe and Botswana, we were pretty psyched to head to Krueger National Park in northeastern South Africa for a four day safari. We were even more excited to be sharing the experience with friends from the States. Our friends Mary, Paul and Jack met up with us in Johannesburg for a week of sights and safari before they head to Uganda for a two week cycling trip. (Very cool!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about Krueger is that it&amp;#8217;s huge &amp;#8211; the size of Wales. As a result, you have to be extra patient while you ride about in an open vehicle with every ounce of clothing on wrapped up in a wool blanket. It is winter here. The chilly mornings and long drives are definitely worth it. Krueger has the greatest variety of animals in Southern Africa and is home to all of the &amp;#8220;Big Five&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; lions, leopards, buffalo, elephants and rhinos. Did you ever wonder why they call them the Big Five? I didn&amp;#8217;t know and couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out why the buffalo rated as one of the Big Five. I mean, we have buffalo in the U.S. Big deal. Turns out Big Five means the five most dangerous land mammals &amp;#8211; or so I was told. Mr. Buffalo is big and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we didn&amp;#8217;t spot any rhinos or leopards, we had many encounters with elephants and buffalo along with many other animals and birds. But perhaps the biggest highlight of our time in Krueger was watching lions. Our first sighting was on a night drive. As Dave was holding the spotlight in search of eyes glowing in the dark, we rolled right up on a pride of 10 lions laying at the very edge of the road. We were speechless. Uh, uh, uh stop please. No wait. Move ahead just a little. It just didn&amp;#8217;t seem right to be sitting in an open vehicle feet away from these guys. Really amazing. And we were just about to give up on the night drive which until the lions had only resulted in seeing the glowing red eyes of the bush baby hopping from tree to tree. Not that I am underestimating the bush baby. he was cute too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It always seemed kind of strange to me the whole idea of going on a safari. Like something you have to have a lot of money, khaki clothes and a funny hat to do. But observing wildlife in its own environment is absolutely fascinating and can be done for a reasonable amount of money. Of course sometimes the animals don&amp;#8217;t always stop and pose for you, but just watching a giraffe chomping on leaves is entertaining. These animals are just surreal. Well, ok not the buffalo so much, but we&amp;#8217;ll still respect his bad-assness.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Poverty &#038; Apartheid</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/poverty-apartheid.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/poverty-apartheid</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Despite the bad wrap and the inconvenience of being a tourist in Johannesburg, a trip there is well worth it to be able to visit Soweto and spend time in the Apartheid Museum. I would recommend, however, that you do not visit both in the same day like we did. It&amp;#8217;s a tremendous amount of information and emotion to absorb in one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited quite a few landmarks throughout Soweto, but one highlight was certainly walking through Kliptown with Bob and learning about his work with the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Kliptown Bob&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sky-foundation.org/&quot;&gt;SKY Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Kliptown is one of several townships that make up Soweto (South Western Townships). At the surface it didn&amp;#8217;t seem significantly different than some of the squatter settlements that I have visited in South America. People live in varied housing from more established brick houses to small tin shacks, the water and sanitation services are limited at best (there are 18 water faucets for 45,000 people!), and there appears to be some sense of community and self help support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real difference seems to be that the townships were intentionally set up as part of a state strategy. These communities are not just the result of people leaving the countryside to look for opportunity in an urban area. Some of the first inhabitants of Soweto were forcibly removed from Sophiatown, a vibrant black community closer to Johannesburg. Once the houses were bulldozed, a new white suburb replaced Sophiatown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit that for me, Soweto was just the name of a township where I imagined a lot of poor black folk live. I had no real sense of how it came to be or the important role that it played in the fight against apartheid. (Did I miss this day in school? Probably not.) Similarly, I can remember talk of apartheid and the boycotts against South Africa back in the 80s, but I could never have grasped the extent to which people were oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this trip is equal parts fun and adventure, it&amp;#8217;s also been an opportunity to better understand other peoples&amp;#8217; history and their struggles. No matter how much we learned (or didn&amp;#8217;t learn) in school or by reading books, there&amp;#8217;s no substitute for seeing, listening and experiencing first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Walls of Johannesburg</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/the-walls-of-johannesburg.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/the-walls-of-johannesburg</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Johannesburg is very sketchy, the crime statistics are scary and in a place where even locals don&amp;#8217;t go out at night tourists have to adapt. As a consequence of crazy crime, the security business is booming &amp;#8211; everyone has high masonry walls around their homes and at least one of the following on top: razor wire, barbed wire, electric fencing, or crushed glass. Every home has a sign advertising the security firm they use and many include an &amp;#8220;Armed Response&amp;#8221; sign as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a city where it&amp;#8217;s not safe to go out after dark almost anywhere, and many places where you can&amp;#8217;t go day or night hostels in Jo&amp;#8217;berg take on Orwellian proportions. Their goal is to have everything you need on site so you don&amp;#8217;t have to leave for any other reason than to go to the museum of the airport. And when you need to go there, they also operate their own in-house taxi service to get you from A to B. The message here is: do not interact with locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would you go to Johannesburg? Good question, well, it&amp;#8217;s a huge transportation hub, and home to the busiest airport in Africa. If you come to South Africa, you are almost certainly going to land here, or transfer here &amp;#8211; welcome to Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malls of Johannesburg&lt;br&gt;
Here is a near complete list of &amp;#8220;Safe&amp;#8221; places to go in Jo&amp;#8217;berg: The Mall, the other Mall, the Casino, and the Apartheid Museum. In our few days in Jo&amp;#8217;Berg we spent a ridiculous amount of time at the Mall. In four days time we probably spent more time in shopping malls than we have in the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jo&amp;#8217;berg, the home of the happy (and safe) shopper.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>QANTASed Again!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/qantased-again.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/qantased-again</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It really never ends. It&amp;#8217;s actually become quite comical. The wrath of QANTAS Beijing is still upon us. One of the changes we made was adding return flights to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe from Johannesburg. Again, after much confusion, we believed that these flights were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much to our delight and surprise, we were upgraded to Business Class on the flight to VF, but we had less luck on the return flight to Jo-burg. In fact, we arrived at the airport only to learn that we were not booked on the flight at all. This isn&amp;#8217;t good when the flight is fully booked for the next week. I guess our paper tickets were for some mystery flight. We&amp;#8217;re still not clear. After some insisting and digging in our heels, we made our way onto the flight without a seat to spare. It really does help to have a paper ticket to wave in front of their faces. It seems to add just a little more legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We suspect that we may not have been on the flight to VF, but that the airport staff passed the buck until we got to the gate and they realized that there were already people in our seats so they just quickly bumped us to solve the problem. That&amp;#8217;s my kind of solution!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we&amp;#8217;ll be calling ahead for every flight just to make sure (1) there is a flight and (2) that we&amp;#8217;re on it. Sometimes those basic details are really important.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So You Wanna Be A Millionaire</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/zimbabwe/so-you-wanna-be-a-millionaire.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/zimbabwe/so-you-wanna-be-a-millionaire</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be a millionaire? Well, if you travel to Zimbabwe your dreams can come true with less than $10. The problem is that you can&amp;#8217;t legally change money at the &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; rate and when you do become a Zim millionaire, there&amp;#8217;s very little left on the shelves to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard about some troubles in Zim. They&amp;#8217;ve been brewing for several years now, but seem to be taking a serious turn for the worse. Inflation is nearing 5000%. That may seem a little abstract to really grasp so let me give you an example of how things were working during our brief visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the wonderful people at our hostel we were able to exchange money at close to the &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; rate which for us was 140,000Zim$ to 1US$. So when we paid 1US$ for a bottle of water at the hostel, we were paying the equivalent of 140,000Zim$ for it. If we had exchanged money at the official rate of 250 Zim$ to the 1US$, the same bottle of water would have cost the equivalent of 560US$. I am not making this up. If you don&amp;#8217;t have the good fortune to be able to change money illegally (and safely), then you&amp;#8217;re forced to pay in US$ &amp;#8211; which means less value for the dollar but of course is still better than using the official exchange rate. Using an ATM or a credit card is absolute insanity as the official rate is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the money you may have a hard time finding something to spend it on. It&amp;#8217;s quite common to walk into a restaurant and have them tell you there&amp;#8217;s no more food left (at 2pm), or no pizza since they&amp;#8217;re out of flour, or sorry no more bottled water. The shortage of food and fuel is largely a result of President Mugabe&amp;#8217;s mandatory call to cut prices in half. Merchants are losing their shirts, and recently many that have closed shop or broken price controls because they can&amp;#8217;t make ends meet are being jailed. The owner of our hostel figures he earns up to 32 years of jail time a day with all the laws he&amp;#8217;s breaking to keep his business running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;d think that in a country where the economic situation is beyond desperate, crime would be an issue. This was not our experience in Victoria Falls &amp;#8211; a town that once boomed with tourism. The people we met on the streets were friendly towards us and simply wanted to trade their carvings and curios for our shoes or even our leftovers. It&amp;#8217;s really a sad situation, and it&amp;#8217;s soon going to be a regional dilemma as refugees pour into neighboring countries. We can&amp;#8217;t speak to the safety of other places in Zimbabwe at this time, but we can recommend giving Vic Falls and the surrounding area a chance.  They&amp;#8217;re really glad to have you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How the Other Half Travels</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/zimbabwe/how-the-other-half-travels.html"/>
        <updated>2007-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/zimbabwe/how-the-other-half-travels</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the first countries we had talked about visiting in Africa was Botswana, but alas the Botswana economy is doing relatively well and tourism tends to cater to the up market, which needless to say is not us. So when we learned that there were overnight trips available from Vic Falls to Chobe National Park in Botswana, we were very excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original plan was to do an overnight camping trip in the park with game drives, boat cruises and &amp;#8220;sundowners&amp;#8221;- game viewing at sunset with a little beverage of choice. Following the normal amount of confusion we of course were unable to do that trip. The alternative was to stay at a private lodge just on the Zim side of the border and then take a day trip to Chobe with the masses. I was a little skeptical that it would be as good, but it was a bit cheaper and our options were running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that mantra: expect the worst, hope for the best? This time we unexpectledy experienced the very best. When we arrived at the lodge and went to our room to freshen up, Dave immediately became concerned. How much is this again? I swear she said it was cheaper than camping. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed one of the most pleasant days of our trip. Dining on fantastic home cooked food made with fresh vegetables from the garden, taking a private guided cruise down the Zambezi, sitting quietly just meters away from a pack of 40 or more elephants and their babies, waking up in our private bungalow to the sounds of hippos along the banks of the river&amp;#8230;so this is how people with money experience Africa! I highly recommend it. It was especially nice because it&amp;#8217;s a very small, private lodge with incredibly personable folks who shared their tales of life in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia I was reminded). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realized it would be hard to top that day of indulgence, but the trip to Chobe National Park also proved rewarding. Chobe has the highest concentration of elephants in Africa, so sighting them is not hard work. Drive to the river. Simple as that. Cruising the Chobe River also affords fun hippo viewing and loads of water fowl. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without knowing it or planning it, we gave ourselves a brief vacation from our travels. Meanwhile we also made it to one little corner of Botswana. No signs of Precious Ramotswe this time, but maybe we&amp;#8217;ll make it back to Botswana in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Victoria Falls &#8211; The Smoke That Thunders</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/zimbabwe/victoria-falls-the-smoke-that-thunders.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/zimbabwe/victoria-falls-the-smoke-that-thunders</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are so glad to be leaving Johannesburg that the thought of going anywhere else is appealing. Even a departure to Zimbabwe &amp;#8211; yes, that Zimbabwe, land of 7000% inflation, of dictatorial rule (Our first dictator, yes!), and shortages of everything &amp;#8211; sounded good. So we happily boarded our flight out of Jo&amp;#8217;berg and didn&amp;#8217;t look back, even though we&amp;#8217;ll head back in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to our delight somehow, magically, we ended up being bumped up to first class, providence was rewarding us for leaving Jo&amp;#8217;berg, it&amp;#8217;s the only explanation that makes sense. I&amp;#8217;ve never had the privilege before, but I hope it happens again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying into Vic Falls is like stepping into a movie about Africa. It looks exactly like it should &amp;#8211; dry, flat and dusty. There&amp;#8217;s little vegetation beyond low scrub and Acacia trees, and the locals are suitably colorful. When we checked into our rooms we asked the owner about security issues &amp;#8211; we were coming from Jo&amp;#8217;berg and the economy here is wrecked and far beyond anything we&amp;#8217;ve ever experienced &amp;#8211; she replied that you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be out on the streets after dark because there had been reports of a male Bull Elephant prowling the area of late. We asked her again, expecting to be warned about well, you know, the locals. She dispelled any fears we had, explaining that the local population were not the type to get into that sort of trouble, and I have to say she was spot on. But Zimbabwe and it&amp;#8217;s people, economy and government are a whole other blog entry. Let&amp;#8217;s talk about Victoria Falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria Falls are like Niagara Falls in that they are both huge waterfalls that divide two countries. You can view the falls from both the Zimbabwe and Zambian sides. If you come here you owe it to yourself to view them from both the Zim and Zam sides. In my opinion Zim has the better part of the falls, but the Zam side is more impressive. You can get closer, and the most dramatic views are on that side. The best view is probably from the bridge downstream on the Zambezi. The bridge is in the &amp;#8220;No Mans Land&amp;#8221; between Zim and Zam, which is another plus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vic Falls is also probably a contender for &amp;#8220;Adrenaline Capitol&amp;#8221; of Africa. You can do a stupid amount of stupid stuff here: Bungie Jump, Gorge Slide, Parasailing, Rafting, Parachuting, pretty much everything you can do that will get you in the hospital. In addition, if those things don&amp;#8217;t do you in, you can go on Safari and see a bunch of animals that can put you in the hospital too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vic Falls should be high on your list of things to see if you&amp;#8217;re planning to come to this side of the world. Were a bit worried we&amp;#8217;d have trouble filling a full week here, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t a issue at all, the Falls are a place that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be rushed. But if you&amp;#8217;re looking for a rush, they can provide that too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Banking in Zim-Zam</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/banking-in-zim-zam.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/banking-in-zim-zam</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re planning a trip to Zimbabwe &amp;#8211; okay, not that many people plan to go to Zim, lets start over &amp;#8211; if you&amp;#8217;re planning a trip to Victoria Falls and flying in, guess what, you&amp;#8217;re going to Zimbabwe. The land of 7000 percent inflation, and the land where the government officially denies that there&amp;#8217;s an issue with inflation. You say, &amp;#8220;What? This is too abstract, can you give me an example of what it&amp;#8217;s like there Dave?&amp;#8221;. Yes I can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were there one US dollar will get you 140,000 Zimbabwe Dollars on the street. The street observes the market reality of the countries inflation issues. If you go into a bank (which has to observe the governments &amp;#8220;Official&amp;#8221; rate to stay in business) and change the same dollar it will get you 250 Zimbabwe Dollars &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s a lot less. So, no one uses banks, even locals. Also, no one uses the ATM (again official rates), or uses credit cards (guess why? official rates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what you use that dollar for: Seven thousand percent inflation mean that if you are lucky enough to find a store or restaurant that can provision itself, prices will be written in pencil and changed every week. For example &amp;#8211; a loaf of bread will cost 500,000 Zim dollars this week, but will cost 1.1 million Zim next week. Do you see where we&amp;#8217;re going with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, you need to come here with all of the hard currency &amp;#8211; Dollars, Euros, Rand &amp;#8211; you plan to use. Or if you&amp;#8217;re near a border you can cross over and use an ATM, or change Travellers checks. Of course carrying a lot of cash in the third world is never fun, but you wanted to see the Falls right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So begins our story: Reading about the difficulties people here have we pulled out a lot of cash in Hong Kong and changed it into Travellers Checks, we pulled out more Rand than we needed at the airport in Johannesburg and we planned to use the ATM just over the border in Zambia. Now, apparently pulling out the daily maximum from three different countries on two continents with a four day span throws up a red flag to the security folks at the bank. When we dipped our debit card into the ATM in Livingston, Zambia it got locked down. No cash for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was kind of a problem, because we still need to pay for a Safari we were planning to leave on the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did this happen? Well, again, we were pulling out cash from different parts of the world, which got someones attention, but we had been diligent before we left called our banks and told them about our travel and named every country we planned to bank in. Zimbabwe was not one of them for the reasons we&amp;#8217;ve already been over, so it shouldn&amp;#8217;t have been a problem right?. Well, for whatever reason the ATM&amp;#8217;s in Livingston , Zambia show up as being in Zimbabwe for Bank of America, and no amount of telling them otherwise was going to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were locked out of our account and it was a pain in the neck to get it unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America has switched to a 800 number system exclusively, trouble is calling a US 800 number from Zimbabwe won&amp;#8217;t work. So I ended up calling Bank of America offices (which have a real number) in the states and asking them to transfer me to their debit card division. First huddle cleared. Next, the phone we were using didn&amp;#8217;t have touch tone dialing and all of BofA&amp;#8217;s systems are automated. It took several calls, but I finally got through to &amp;#8220;Ted&amp;#8221;, explaining to him that he was my lifeline, and if I lost him, I lost all hope in BofA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was great, he treated me as if I were a caller to a suicide hot line: &amp;#8220;David, I&amp;#8217;m going to put you on hold for a moment. But I want you to understand it&amp;#8217;s because I&amp;#8217;m going to connect you with the person that can help you, and explain your situation to them. This will take a minute or two, but I am not going to disconnect until you are on the phone with them. Do you understand?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within minutes we had the hold on our card removed and were back in business.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fear and Loathing on Flight 749 to Johannesburg</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/fear-and-loathing-on-flight-749-to-johannesburg.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/south-africa/fear-and-loathing-on-flight-749-to-johannesburg</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Things not to do on a flight to South Africa include: read a South African newspaper. LeeAnne did just that and it was fairly unnerving. South Africa in general and Johannesburg in particular have issues with crime. And while most of it is based in the poorer African Townships, it still makes the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point in our flight LeeAnne turned to me and asked &amp;#8220;Would you like to know about what I just read in this Johannesburg newspaper?&amp;#8221;. I turned and saw just one headline before I replied &amp;#8211; the headline read: &amp;#8220;Lone Cop Fights Off Gang of 8 with AK-47&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;. Nope please keep it to yourself babe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still there is something reassuring about being an American in a country that&amp;#8217;s more violent and with deeper racial issues than my own. South Africans and Americans are really cousins in that regard &amp;#8211; but I&amp;#8217;m glad I can go back to the US.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/zai-jian-china</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;China is not a developing nation, it&amp;#8217;s developed. And we all might understand soon just how developed they are. I&amp;#8217;ve never met a people who are more determined to make an impression on the world than these folks. Today China, tomorrow &amp;#8211; well, probably Taiwan &amp;#8211; but then &amp;#8230;the World!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hostels in China are terrific. The number and quality of them surprised us, lots of YHA options these days too, so get your membership before you arrive. Generally, they are cheap and most are either new or only 4 or 5 years old, so everything is shiny and new. Transportation in China also really surprised and impressed us. We were blown away by how modern the road network was and the buses were very comfortable. Now, bear in mind were were coming from India where the transportation system leaves something to be desired, so in comparison China ruled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of sights and things to do, the culture and natural beauty of the Southwest trumped the monuments and architecture of the North and East. Go to Tiger Leaping Gorge before the Dam is completed, see the South-West if at all possible, you will be greatly rewarded. Make time for it, shaving a few days off your time in Beijing or Shanghai will pay off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the place I most wanted to visit before this trip an so far it&amp;#8217;s the place I most want to come back to. Thanks China, have a great time ruling the World, I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;ll do a great job.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things We Love(d) About China</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/things-we-loved-about-china.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/things-we-loved-about-china</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no denying it. We&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed China. We didn&amp;#8217;t fall in love with the big cities of the east coast, but the western and southwestern provinces are spectacular &amp;#8211; filled with stunning scenery and diverse people. In summary, here are a few of our favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;mountains&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; The mountains of the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces provided some of the most beautiful and dramatic scenery of our trip. Hiking Tiger Leaping Gorge was a definite highlight for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;point and fry&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; Finding veg food in China has been a source of endless frustration. It certainly exists and when we do find it, it&amp;#8217;s been pretty tasty. By far some of the best and cheapest food has been at bus stops on our long distance journeys. There are usually a number of stalls with numerous bowls of fresh ingredients. You just walk up and point to the ingredients you like and they fry it up for you. Fast, fresh and cheap!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;air conditioning&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; Sitting there in your overly cooled office, you are probably taking for granted that you are chilled to the bone right now. Well, after two months of very little AC in India, we were most pleased to find out the AC is the norm on most buses, trains and in hostel rooms. Ah&amp;#8230;refreshing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;Sun Jie Hai commercial&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; Sun Jie Hai is Chinese and plays professional soccer in England. With great regularity, CCTV 9 (the English language propaganda channel) plays a commercial for London based Jade Travel featuring Sun Jie Jai and another guy we suspect if just a regular old footy fan. It&amp;#8217;s not entirely clear to me why we laugh every single time the commercial is on and continue to quote it randomly throughout the day, but I think it may have to do with the way the footy fan asks Jie Hai, &amp;#8220;Oh, why&amp;#8221; as if he were Garth from Wayne&amp;#8217;s World. He even kind of distorts his mouth like him and looks uncomfortable. Sadly there&amp;#8217;s no Jie Hai commercial on YouTube and we didn&amp;#8217;t manage to video it ourselves. I haven&amp;#8217;t done it justice, but I tell you it&amp;#8217;s hilarious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;peoples&amp;#8217; parks&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; A highlight of China&amp;#8217;s cities is it&amp;#8217;s parks. They are pleasant places to stroll around and observe an older generation of Chinese men and women performing impromptu concerts, playing traditional musical instruments, practicing tai chi or flying elaborate kites. This is the China you probably won&amp;#8217;t see in 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;Chinese kids&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; We&amp;#8217;re not sure what it is, but they are incredibly cute &amp;#8211; especially the boys. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s the buzz cut or maybe it&amp;#8217;s all the doting they get as the only child in the family. Who knows, but they sure made more than one bus ride entertaining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;bicycles&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; This is THE bike nation. There are special lanes for cyclists, monitored bike parking lots and portable bike repair shops all around town. Though it seems the personal auto is one the rise, hopefully the tradition of pedaling to and fro won&amp;#8217;t go away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Hong Kong Part Deux</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/hong-kong-part-deux.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/hong-kong-part-deux</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, it&amp;#8217;s hot in Hong Kong! When we were here in May it was just steamy, now it&amp;#8217;s downright unpleasant. Thats not the only thing that changes quickly in Hong Kong: a bakery and Vegetarian Restaurant that we loved on our first trip were closed on our second visit &amp;#8211; only two months later. The pace of change in China is quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second trip to Hong Kong is required for us on this trip, and very welcome, we loved it first time around. Hong Kong is also the only city we can fly from to get to Africa on our OneWorld Explorer ticket, so here we are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing couldn&amp;#8217;t be better. Hong Kong is hosting the Barclays Asia Cup this year, and Liverpool FC (my favorite English team) is playing. Tickets weren&amp;#8217;t available online, so there was some chewing of fingernails when we go in. The first games were the same day we arrived. So we sprinted from the airport to our room to the stadium without tickets, but still got in to see Portsmouth v. Fulham and Liverpool v. South China FC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other activities involved visiting the Avenue of the Stars. It&amp;#8217;s kind of like the Hollywood walk of fame &amp;#8211; hand prints in concrete &amp;#8211; but it&amp;#8217;s for Hong Kong Kung Fu stars, and theres a statue of Bruce Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also took the Cable Car up to Victoria Peak while we weren&amp;#8217;t waiting on the elevator at Miradoor Mansion (where we were staying in a cubby hole) for about a quarter of the time we were there (or so it seemed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love Hong Kong and hope to visit again real soon &amp;#8211; you should too!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Doh! We&#8217;ve been Shanghai&#8217;d!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/doh-weve-been-shanghaid.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/doh-weve-been-shanghaid</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just when we thought everything was resolved with our flights, it turns out that it wasn&amp;#8217;t.  You&amp;#8217;d think that even the less than stellar women at the Qantas office in Beijing who issued us new paper tickets or the very stellar AA women in the U.S. who helped clean up the Beijing mess might have noticed that our very next flight &amp;#8211; from Shanghai to Hong Kong &amp;#8211; had been changed&amp;#8230;. six months ago.  But I guess not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned up at the airport for our 10:35pm flight on Monday, but when it wasn&amp;#8217;t listed on the monitor, we began to worry.  Crap.  It turns out that flight was changed to 12:35pm some time ago.  How were we to know?  We thought the flight had been confirmed just the week before.   Thankfully the Cathay Pacific staff person booked us on the flight for the following day.  And we made sure to reconfirm (again) our flight to Johannesburg on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you just can&amp;#8217;t leave Shanghai without some surprise!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shanghai Shoppers</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/shanghai-shoppers.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/shanghai-shoppers</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in Shanghai at the moment, and we&amp;#8217;ve had another near miss with my cousin Sam Forrest, we had a close encounter with him in New Zealand, but we were on opposite sides of the North Island. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architecturally this is the most interesting city in China, because of it&amp;#8217;s mixture of Ultramodern and Deco styles. There&amp;#8217;s also a huge influence on the city from Europe. It&amp;#8217;s narrow winding roads are one of the many signs of European influence on the City. Nicknamed &amp;#8220;Paris of the East&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Whore of the Orient&amp;#8221;. It gives you an idea of what Westerners and Asians thought of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been much more pleasant to visit Shanghai during the Spring or Fall &amp;#8211; Summers here are too hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanghai is home to China&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Golden Mile&amp;#8221; and some of the alleged best shopping in China. In reality, there isn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot else to do here and it&amp;#8217;s so steamy hot that you&amp;#8217;re actually thankful to find an air conditioned mall on every corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in addition to strolling along the Bund, people watching down Nanjing Lu, and absorbing a little of the French Concession, we did manage to take in one historic site &amp;#8211; the site of the 1st National Congress of the CCP. This was the site, 86 years ago today, of the secret meeting of 13 delegates who founded a formal and unified Communist Party of China. The museum was pretty interesting and a reminder that the CCP today is not the party of yesterday. Seriously. After an hour&amp;#8217;s worth of reading exhibits about defeating the &amp;#8220;bourgeois&amp;#8221; you can step outside directly into one of Shanghai&amp;#8217;s premiere shopping districts, something akin to the new outdoor urban malls of the US. If China is nothing else, it is ironic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Party history aside, we could live without Shanghai. If you love cities and shopping, then perhaps it should make your China itinerary. But it if you&amp;#8217;re more interested in really getting to know China and seeing it&amp;#8217;s magnificent scenery, give it a pass.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Olympic Fever &#8211; Beijing</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/olympic-fever-beijing.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/olympic-fever-beijing</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The truth about Beijing, if you&amp;#8217;ve been in China a while, is you only need a few days to see the sights, then get out &amp;#8230;unless you want to go shopping. Then you could be there a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is like many other major Chinese cites: big, crowded, noisy and polluted. After you&amp;#8217;ve seen sights I&amp;#8217;d advise you to get out or get shopping. The two biggest advantages Beijing has over other cities is it&amp;#8217;s connected-ness to the rest of China by plane bus and rail, and it&amp;#8217;s abundance of bargain shopping outlets. Also, I understand they are having the Olympics here next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day in Beijing it&amp;#8217;s impossible to not know where the 2008 Olympics are being held. The whole city is working 24/7 on the preparations and &amp;#8220;One World, One Dream&amp;#8221; is pasted everywhere. It&amp;#8217;s even pasted up on the Great Wall. After the Olympics are over everyone in Beijing should be entitled to a good sleep, it will be well deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the sights and shopping, they will be here forever. We went to the &amp;#8220;Big Four&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; The Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, the Great Wall and IKEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the first sight we took in was the smog, it was remarkable. We&amp;#8217;d heard a lot about the pollution in China, but hadn&amp;#8217;t really seen anything that bad in our first month and a half here. But on the train back from Mongolia we had a chance to check it out, and live in it for our first two days in Beijing. Now I understand &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s very impressive. We were at one end of Tiananmen Square and could hardly see the opposite end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for us a storm rolled through and cleared all the muck out of the air for us after a couple of days, leaving us with breathable air. Rumor has it the government is going to restrict personal automobile traffic in Beijing for a month next year to try and limit the smog during the games. Hope it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our visit to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City really was like a walk through the clouds &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;Can you see it over there?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;What?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Nevermind.&amp;#8221; And sadly, we must report that the Starbucks in the Forbidden City has closed. We got there a week late. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More interesting was our visit to Beijings other &amp;#8220;City&amp;#8221;, it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/125961.htm&quot;&gt;Underground City&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, constructed at the height of the Cold War when Mao was anticipating a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union any day. It&amp;#8217;s pretty crazy (and much cooler than top-side Beijing in July). They tunneled out many miles and built factories, theaters, etc all underground. Now, you can pay 20 Yuan and get a tour of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making up for a somewhat lackluster visit to the downtown sites we headed up to the Great Wall the following day. The Wall is pretty amazing and if you get there early enough you&amp;#8217;ll miss the mad crowds. Also, did you know there is a slide from the top to the bottom? I had no idea! It&amp;#8217;s a few hundred feet long and and looks like a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last stop was IKEA. We have no furniture needs, we just went to see one of the biggest IKEA&amp;#8217;s in the world and eat cheap ice cream. Note &amp;#8211; Alcohol is not regulated in China the same way it is in the States, so at the IKEA Cafe you can order a beer, wine (like LeeAnne did) or hard liquor. Sometimes you need that to shop here I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IKEA was actually only the first stop on what was suppose to be a tour of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stadiumguide.com/beijing.htm&quot;&gt;Beijing Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and Olympic Park. But we never got there &amp;#8211; it had nothing to do with the wine. After our ice cream we determined the only way to get out to the park was by taxi &amp;#8211; the Metro line there isn&amp;#8217;t open yet &amp;#8211; and we didn&amp;#8217;t want to pay $30 in cab fare that day. It&amp;#8217;s a decision I kind of regret as the stadium design is very impressive. It&amp;#8217;s ultra-modern &amp;#8211; the whole thing looks like a seven story high birds nest. But, it&amp;#8217;s okay, I have a feeling it will be on TV some next summer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Showdown at Qantas Office &#8211; Beijing</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/showdown-at-qantas-office-beijing.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/showdown-at-qantas-office-beijing</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So part of the attraction of our Round the World ticket is it&amp;#8217;s flexibility. Once you&amp;#8217;ve identified you&amp;#8217;re destinations and flight dates you can change your dates at will. So if you get some where and love it you can stay longer, or if you get somewhere and hate it you can jet out, and for a fee you can change your destinations entirely. This flexibility is one of the reasons we went with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneworld.com&quot;&gt;OneWorld Alliance ticket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you&amp;#8217;re planning things you plan them in a perfect world. Reality sometimes sets in when you try to actually use this flexibility. First off, it&amp;#8217;s free to change your dates using the OneWorld Explorer ticket. This is true, unless you bought your ticket from Qantas. Qantas charges a 25 dollar fee each time you change your dates. This applies to us even though we bought our tickets through American Airlines. What to know why? We bought our tickets at the American Airlines desk in Auckland. And the American Airlines desk in Auckland is just that, a desk in a Qantas office, therefore everything gets printed on Qantas stock and we get to pay extra for services that should be free. Kind of annoying, but what are you going to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve made date changes to our tickets twice already, and each time they went swimmingly. So when we decided we wanted to make both date and destination changes in Beijing we weren&amp;#8217;t expecting any problems. There were problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, we wanted to make destination changes in part because two new airlines have joined the alliance: Royal Jordanian and MALÉV, the national carrier of Hungary. Adding these two add a lot of options for flights to the Mid-East and Central/Eastern Europe. We were pretty excited about the possibilities, so we headed down to the Qantas office in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to any Qantas ticket holders thinking about going into the Beijing office &amp;#8211; they have no idea what they&amp;#8217;re doing. Stay away! Stay away! Stay away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two minutes in the office I knew the wisest thing was to get our tickets out of the hands of the Qantas rep who had them and get as far away as possible. When she told us she didn&amp;#8217;t know that Namibia was in Africa we were concerned. When she thought Victoria Falls was in Europe we were very concerned. When she told us that a British Airways flight wasn&amp;#8217;t part of the alliance, I just wanted to run away. We agreed on a &amp;#8220;Face-Saving&amp;#8221; maneuver &amp;#8211; she would read up on the OneWorld alliance rules, and we would give her a list of changes we would like to make. We left relieved that nothing at all had been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple of days. After &amp;#8220;educating&amp;#8221; herself she started to make the changes we had requested. We where notified by email. But instead of making all the changes she made just two. I immediately called the office and she told me that the changes she made would cost $150 each and for the rest of them I should &amp;#8220;Probably go to Hong Kong office. Much bigger, more use to this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really wasn&amp;#8217;t the response we were looking for. So we headed back down to the Qantas office as soon as we could, and luckily got hold of someone who mostly knew what she was doing &amp;#8211; even though she had to be &amp;#8220;convinced&amp;#8221; that Royal Jordanian was now a OneWorld partner and that &amp;#8220;Yes, you can&amp;#8221; book us on that airline. We got mostly all the changes we were looking for, and it only took the better part of three days. Three trips to the Qantas Beijing office and a couple of &amp;#8220;double check&amp;#8221; calls to the American Airlines Round the World ticket desk in the states (All of whom are extremely competent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the winners in our ticket change are Victoria Falls and Istanbul. The losers: Mauritius and Nairobi. Why: All the cheap accommodation in Mauritius (there is very little to begin with) was booked up and we didn&amp;#8217;t feel like sleeping in the airport for a week. Nairobi lost out because we decided we didn&amp;#8217;t want to trek overland in Africa for a month. So instead we&amp;#8217;re flying into and out of Vic Falls and spending the better part of a week in Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have said to us that Qantas is really an acronym for Queer and Nasty Try Another Service. We do not believe this. The reps we&amp;#8217;ve used in other Qantas offices have been terrific, and we&amp;#8217;d love it if they worked in Beijing, but they don&amp;#8217;t and the folks in that office aren&amp;#8217;t really up to speed with OneWorld tickets. Too bad they&amp;#8217;re having the Olympics here next year. If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qantas.com.au/needhelp/dyn/contacts/teleSalesContacts#jump2&quot;&gt;absolutely have to use this office&lt;/a&gt;, my advice would be to have all of your details figured out before you go in (flight numbers, carrier codes, the works). You may have to dig in your heals on some points, but you&amp;#8217;ll (probably) get the changes you need.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sain Yavaarai Mongolia!</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those planning a trip to Mongolia &amp;#8211; don&amp;#8217;t bother leaving UB if you are a Vegan or Lactose Intolerant. You will starve! These people love their meat and dairy products. It makes sense, most people here are nomads and don&amp;#8217;t want to stick around in one place long enough to grow a crop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said UB is not really Mongolia, but you&amp;#8217;ll have to come here anyway. All international flights and trains stop here. The trouble starts when you figure this out and try to leave UB. It&amp;#8217;s not as easy or as comfortable to traverse the country as it is in other places. It&amp;#8217;s best to have a plan to escape UB before you even get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you do get out into the country you can really start to enjoy yourself. The countryside is great, but the people here are the best assets that Mongolia has. They&amp;#8217;re extremely generous with everything they have (especially their Vodka &amp;#8211; made from fermented mares milk, YUM) and are always ready to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mongolia Notes for Budget Travelers</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/mongolia-notes-for-budget-travelers.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/mongolia-notes-for-budget-travelers</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mongolia is a bit different than the other countries we have visited thus far. There is only one real city, UB, and there is very little infrastructure to support public transport around the country. As we mentioned in &lt;a title=&quot;Ger to Ger&quot; href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=141&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Off We Ger&lt;/a&gt; if you want to get out into the countryside, which is really THE reason to come to Mongolia, then you need to a) join a tour; b) hire a jeep; or c) be &lt;a title=&quot;Modes of Transport&quot; href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=143&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;completely raving mad&lt;/a&gt;and take the local long distance buses. You could also fly, but since that wasn&amp;#8217;t remotely within our budget (boohoo), I&amp;#8217;ve left it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tours run the gamut from budget backpackers piled into Russian vans that look like VW buses to the Golden Circle gang who get flown into luxury ger camps and driven around in shiny Landcruisers. (Yes, I&amp;#8217;m a little envious.) Many travelers join together a group of 3-4 people and hire a jeep and driver. This can work out to be a pretty good deal since you choose your route and have freedom to stop whenever and wherever you choose. Since there were only two of us and we were not organized enough to find other people to share the costs of a jeep, we skipped option b. Our disorganization and adversity to tour groups ruled out option a as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you may have read, we went with Ger to Ger, an organization that supports sustainable tourism among nomadic herders. Good organization, good philosophy, a little loose on some details, but still a very good, authentic and low cost experience. That said, taking the bus to and fro was pure, sheer, total hell like no other. And yes, I had the bruises to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of lodging, outside of UB, the main choices are basic hotels, ger camps (both luxury and budget) and camping. Mongolia is excellent for camping and it&amp;#8217;s free. Just pitch your tent and snooze. Many ger camps seem to cater to foreigners offering less authentic experiences at tourist prices. And from what I&amp;#8217;ve heard hotels range from grotty to decent. Not a lot of luxury in this category. Lucky for us, we stayed at what may be one of the nicest guesthouses outside of UB. This was mighty welcome after a week of no showers. AND they had a cafe with a vegetarian menu. Sadly we missed the veggie burger, but did have some tasty bakery treats for the bus ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within UB, pretty much the same lodging choices exist except that there are loads of guesthouses and some nicer hotels. Our guesthouse was bare bones at best, but to be honest we didn&amp;#8217;t mind since we were the only ones there most of the time. Plus the owner was a really great guy. As always, dorms are cheaper and most places have shared baths. We paid a pretty average $16 per night for a room with a double bed (and literally nothing else!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food is relatively inexpensive in UB and even cheaper in the countryside, though choices are more limited there. UB has a surprising plethora of western restaurants thanks to the number of NGOs and foreign aid agencies. Though the food was inexpensive by western standards, it was a little bit more than we had been paying in China and India. Still a bargain. If you visit UB, don&amp;#8217;t miss the weird mix of flavors at Los Bandidos &amp;#8211; Mongolia&amp;#8217;s only Indian-Mexican restaurant. We went three times for the nachos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Mongolia is pretty good for budget travel. The lack of infrastructure outside of the city prohibits it from being super cheap, but we managed pretty well on an average of about $50 a day including the trek, transport, food, lodging, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nadaam</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/nadaam.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/nadaam</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nadaam is the national festival of Mongolia. Indeed, the Mongolian word for festival is Nadaam. Imagine, if you will, a very large State Fair with a Super Bowl type opening ceremony and an emphasis on sports and you will come close to what Nadaam is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadaam is basically a big three day celebration of Mongolia&amp;#8217;s favorite sports &amp;#8211; Horse Racing, Archery and Wrestling. There&amp;#8217;s also something called &amp;#8220;Ankle Bone Shooting&amp;#8221; in there but no one outside of Mongolia knows what it is so it&amp;#8217;s often forgotten. Nadaam is celebrated all over the country in early July, but the biggest &amp;#8220;festival&amp;#8221; of them all is in UB. That&amp;#8217;s where the tourists and the big opening ceremony is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening ceremony is quite something to see, tickets are hard to come by and the National Stadium is packed to beyond capacity. As the opening ceremony ends the Wrestling begins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mongolian wrestling is somewhere between Sumo wrestling and a shoving match &amp;#8211; the first guy to put a knee on the ground looses. There are no weight classes so of the 512 participants in the first round &amp;#8211; you can usually put your money on the fattest two reaching the final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second to wrestling is Horse Racing. Never will you meet a people who love their horses more than Mongolians. And they don&amp;#8217;t care for these little one mile tracks we have in the West. Mongolians races are over 18 miles in length. And the glory for the winner goes not to the jockey, but the horse, then the trainer, then the rider. The riders are all boys between maybe 6 to 12 years old. They sing to they&amp;#8217;re horses before the race, and in some cases during. Some of them should concentrate on staying on the horse. It&amp;#8217;s not uncommon for riders to fall off, and there&amp;#8217;s no penalty for a horse finishing the race without his jockey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archery is the only sport at Nadaam that allows both men and women to participate. Archers can only use traditional Mongolian bows and their perform ace is based on accuracy. Well, what else would it be based on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankle Bone Shooting is the strangest sport at Nadaam for foreigners to get their heads around. As the name may suggest you are playing with ankle bones and trying to flick them at a target some 10 or 12 feet away. You probably played something like this in middle school with a piece of paper folded into a square, that you would try to flick across a table. Well, here there are a lot more ankle bones than paper, and it&amp;#8217;s played by grown men who sing and chant while they do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadaam in UB is interesting, were we to go back I&amp;#8217;d like to check out the country version &amp;#8211; sans opening ceremony and TV coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modes of Travel in Mongolia</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/modes-of-travel-in-mongolia.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/modes-of-travel-in-mongolia</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The tricky think about Mongolia is that you have to get out of UB and into the countryside to really get a feeling for the country, but it&amp;#8217;s hard as hell to get out of UB. The main reason for this is the road system &amp;#8211; there isn&amp;#8217;t one. Or rather there will be one, there are hopeful signs, they&amp;#8217;re working on it, but right now &amp;#8211; you can&amp;#8217;t get 100 kilometers away from the city and be on pavement the whole time. Supposedly, once complete it will connect one end of the country with the other, and people say every year the roads are getting better, but if this is better &amp;#8230;damn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your choices in leaving UB then are limited. Here they are in order of preference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fly &amp;#8211; Absolutely the best way to travel in a country double the size of Texas having no real road network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Train &amp;#8211; Connecting only a few points, but safe and reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Hire a Vehicle &amp;#8211; If you must venture out on the Yak trails that double for roads here, hire someone to drive you, and only you to your destination and back. Expensive, but in the end worth it. There are loads of people with Land Cruisers and old Soviet era Jeeps and Vans making a living off of people just like you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Don&amp;#8217;t Go at All &amp;#8211; You should seriously consider this option if the above won&amp;#8217;t work for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Mini Bus &amp;#8211; The worst possible option. Are you familiar with the works of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Willis&quot;&gt;Wesley Willis&lt;/a&gt;? &amp;#8220;Freak-Out Hell-Bus&amp;#8221; is a good description for the Mini-Buses in this country. Mongolians take almost everything the own with them when they travel on these damn things. The bus will be oversold by 50%, the aisles clogged with bags, and unless your sitting next to the door you&amp;#8217;ll have to climb over seats to get out of the bus &amp;#8211; I am not making this up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;#8217;s good to go into Mongolia with a plan. Otherwise you&amp;#8217;ll like spend a day or three in UB trying to figure out how to get out of UB and into the countryside. Mongolia is a great place, but getting out the the good stuff can be a drag.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tales from the Mongolian Countryside</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/tales-from-the-mongolian-countryside.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/tales-from-the-mongolian-countryside</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since my time in Peace Corps, my motto has kind of been &amp;#8220;hope for the best, but expect the worst.&amp;#8221; With this frame of mind, you&amp;#8217;re generally prepared for everything to go wrong and pleasantly surprised when it doesn&amp;#8217;t. Keeps the expectations in check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we set out on our ger to ger adventure, I thought we had asked all the right questions, but you just can&amp;#8217;t help it when some of the answers are well&amp;#8230;wrong. Take food for instance. When two vegetarians are going trekking far, far away from any 7-Elevens into the heart of meat lovers land, you want to make sure you have an adequate amount of food to keep you going. And we did. We packed what we considered to be ample food and snacks to get us through the 6 meals we understood we&amp;#8217;d have to provide for ourselves over the course of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, imagine our surprise when at lunch on the first day we found out that we were to provide our own food for lunch everyday. Oops. That&amp;#8217;s 5 more meals. Well, if we each eat one peanut butter sandwich for lunch, have 8 peanuts and 2 cookies, we might just make it. That is unless our bread molds by the end of the week &amp;#8211; which it did. There was also the small detail about providing the herders with a tent and some food on the two nights that you camp out with them away from a family ger. Uh, what? Didn&amp;#8217;t know about that either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while this sounds like a disaster in the making, it really was not at all. We were extremely fortunate to be tagging along with a French guide, Noemi, and her family for the week. Not only did they share their tea, curry and chocolate with us on a few occasions, but Noemi in all honesty acted as our guide as well. We learned so much more than we could have on our own and were able to communicate a bit more with the families. She also provided food and tents for the herders when we camped, saving us from looking like total dimwits had we been on our own. We owe her something good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistics aside, we had a great time. There&amp;#8217;s a vastness about the Mongolia countryside that at times could have been boring, but really just made us appreciate that we were far away from it all. And learning a little about the life of a nomadic herder was really quite interesting. There are no crops, just animals and only ones you can herd such as yaks, sheep and goats. The families move to different valleys or to higher land depending on the season or their needs. They just pack up the ger and go. Apparently a ger can be assembled in less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer, families live off the more than 40 dairy products that can produce from these animals and in the winter it&amp;#8217;s dried meat. Nothing is wasted. Yak hair can be used to make ropes, sheep wool can be turned into felt for gers and mare&amp;#8217;s milk is fermented into an odd tasting home brew. Lucky for us, we got to sample more than a few of the local treats &amp;#8211; lots and lots of cheese which is dried and quite hard but kind of grows on you after a couple of days; the yogurt which is divine; and a kind of thick heavy cream which you can layer on top of your &lt;em&gt;bortzig&lt;/em&gt; (Mongolian donuts) or eat with fried pancake-like bread. Mongolia is certainly not a good place if you&amp;#8217;re lactose intolerant, but we did just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visiting a families&amp;#8217; ger involves a lot of tradition and ritual which we got to experience first hand. Visitors sit in specific places inside the ger, you always receive food and drink with your right hand or with both hands, you never set down a cup of tea without taking a drink first, and you at least act like you&amp;#8217;re tasting the &lt;em&gt;airag&lt;/em&gt; (fermented mare&amp;#8217;s milk) when it&amp;#8217;s passed to you&amp;#8230;even at breakfast! We survived all this ritual and even the snuff passing with little drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thanks to Noemi and the wonderful families we visited, and despite the misinformation, the many blisters on our feet and the fact that noone came to pick us up at the end while we sat in the middle of nowhere, we had a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lucky for us someone at a ger not more than a few kilometers away had a jeep and was willing to drive us 100 km! Or we may still be eating dried cheese and playing cards with our young friend Benti in Central Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Off We Ger</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/off-we-ger.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/off-we-ger</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of the allure of Mongolia is getting the heck out of UB and heading to the countryside. The only complication with that is that you can&amp;#8217;t just hop on a bus and wing it like we have in other countries. There is very little public transport and the distances between towns is quite vast. Most travelers pre-book an organized tour or arrive in town and hire a jeep and driver to get them out into the countryside. Since we&amp;#8217;re not really interested in the former and the latter is just a little out of our budget, we opted for a trek with Ger to Ger. The extra bonus is that they have a great philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll be spending the next 8 days trekking with local nomads from one families&amp;#8217; ger (yurt) to the next through the Arhangai region of Mongolia. We&amp;#8217;ll experience their way of life and their food. We&amp;#8217;ll also learn nifty tricks like how to play the national anklebone game, how to milk a sheep and how to pack a yak &amp;#8211; all new skills we&amp;#8217;ll surely be able to add to our resume!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, can you think of a better thing for two non-meat eating, non-vodka drinking, non-Mongolia speaking people to do than to throw themselves at the mercy of nomads for a week? We&amp;#8217;ll be eating lots of rice and yogurt. And of course we&amp;#8217;ll drag along some peanut butter just in case. We can&amp;#8217;t think of a better way to enjoy Mongolia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re really bored at work, you can read about our trek and the ger to ger philosophy at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gertoger.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.gertoger.org/families-route/arhangai-bluelake-route.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll let you know how it gers!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>China Notes for Budget Travelers</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/china-notes-for-budget-travelers.html"/>
        <updated>2007-07-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/china-notes-for-budget-travelers</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our original budget for China was based on the costs of the big cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. Our goal was to stay at or below $70 a day for both of us. We were able to get by on about that in Hong Kong, but were able to easily stay below $50 a day for most of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a welcome change and was in large part thanks to the vast network of YHA hostels that have come online in the last couple of years. Our lodging rarely exceeded $20 for a double room with the exception of Hong Kong where you pay $30-35 for a tidy little matchbox. The lowest we paid was about $2.50 for a basic twin room in Tiger Leaping Gorge and the average was likely somewhere between $10-$15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we did have to opt for a Chinese hotel, the rule of thumb was bargain. Never pay the quoted rate for anything in China, especially hotel rooms. They were a little more money and a little more worn that the hostels, but still served the purpose. Trying to communicate with them at what time and for how long the hot water works was a whole different issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food was always an interesting endeavor. If you go for western restaurants, where they are available, you more or less pay western prices. Food in general is not very expensive, but finding a place with an English menu or an English speaker was the challenge. The best way to go was the little stalls in the side alleys where the food is fresh and you can point to what you&amp;#8217;d like. We took our chances with our botched Chinese and Mandarin phrasebook on more than one occasion. Typically we ended up with some rice and sauteed bok choy &amp;#8211; for which I admit I began to develop a slight fondness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a few fast and fancy train rides, we didn&amp;#8217;t really have any budget breakers in China. Some of the sites have ridiculously high entrance fees, but that was usually offset by cheap lodging and food. Overall, China offered a lot of bang for the buck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Call Me UB &#8211; Ulaanbaator</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/call-me-ub-ulaanbaator.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/mongolia/call-me-ub-ulaanbaator</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ulaanbaator is a sleepy medium-size town that happens to be the capitol and only real city of any size in Mongolia. The Soviets essentially built this city and it&amp;#8217;s painfully obvious in the architecture, monuments and city planning that the Mongolians had little say. If you were dropped in the middle of UB (as it&amp;#8217;s known to the local ex-pat community), you could easily think you were in a Siberian factory town. Outside of Shukbaataar Square the town is composed of low-rise Soviet apartment buildings, with a rather huge ring of Ger-&amp;#8216;burbs surrounding the city. It stands in contrast to all the new-shiny construction with a definite Asian theme we&amp;#8217;d grown use to in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviets didn&amp;#8217;t just leave behind a bunch of buildings and monuments when they left. Black Russian bread and cheese, wonderful cheese (something you don&amp;#8217;t see too much of in China) is all to easy to come by. There are still a few conspicuously Russian faces in town, and a huge, huge, three block long, one block wide Russian Embassy (they probably needed the space when they ran the country) is located within sight of the Parliament House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town itself is a bit sleepy, I mean that literally, at 9AM we are some of the first people out on the street &amp;#8211; also in contrast to China. The locals themselves are proud as punch to claim Chingis Khan as one of their own. In his spirit they don&amp;#8217;t like to stand in line, drive like maniacs and drink like &amp;#8230;well they drink like Russians, but anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Life on the Trans-Mongolian Express</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/life-on-the-trans-mongolian-express.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/life-on-the-trans-mongolian-express</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When young Mongolians ask their parents where white people come from I&amp;#8217;m sure many are tempted to say &amp;#8220;From the Trans-Mongolian Express&amp;#8221;. After being a pair of white dots in a sea of Chinese faces for over a month it was a little shocking being in the majority on this train from Beijing to Ulaanbaatar. We boarded early on Monday morning at a crowded train station in Beijing &amp;#8211; nothing new there &amp;#8211; but it was unusually easy to find our platform, as soon as the station attendant saw our faces she said &amp;#8220;Ulaanbaatar?&amp;#8221; and pointed us to Track 2. There we boarded the train with a ridiculous number of other backpackers, some headed to Mongolia, others headed on to Moscow or other parts of Russia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train is called the Trans-Mongolian Express, but I would suggest &amp;#8220;Express&amp;#8221; is used very liberally here. These trains are slow, old and Soviet. In fact they were the first trains in China we&amp;#8217;ve been on that didn&amp;#8217;t have AC &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s because they&amp;#8217;re not Chinese trains, their Mongolian &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s not because you don&amp;#8217;t need air conditioning on this 30 hour train ride that crosses the Gobi desert, it&amp;#8217;s because they are old Soviet trains. I take it back, there is AC on the train, there are two classes &amp;#8211; Soft Sleeper, and Deluxe. In Soft Sleeper you&amp;#8217;re in a compartment with four berths and nice soft wide beds, but no AC. In Deluxe you&amp;#8217;re in a compartment with two beds, your own personal shower and AC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It landscape changes quickly on the train from massive smoggy Cityscape to rolling countryside, then you pass through the Great Wall into the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. By night-time you&amp;#8217;re at the Mongolian border and your thinking &amp;#8220;Hey, not too bad!&amp;#8221;, then you sit at the border for about five hours as the train changes it&amp;#8217;s gauge and your passport gets processed on both sides of the border. All of a sudden it&amp;#8217;s close to 2AM, where did the time go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise! It&amp;#8217;s dusty &amp;#038; hot in the Gobi, and unfortunately for us, we were in a car without AC, so your choices are sit and sweat it out in the compartment with the windows up, or put them down and eat dust all night. We chose to sweat it out. When you wake up the green is all gone, the landscape is flat as a pancake and you are definitely in the middle of the desert. By lunchtime the green has returned the land starts to undulate again and there are even a few trees around &amp;#8211; you are nearing your destination: Ulaanbaatar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell you&amp;#8217;re nearing civilization again as the amount of litter outside the train increases. On our approach to UB as it&amp;#8217;s known in there parts Ulaanbaator was confused for a large parking lot &amp;#8211; I am not making this up. Actually, it was an easy mistake to make, the outer &amp;#8220;suburbs&amp;#8221; of town are mainly Ger (Mongolian tents) cities, so it&amp;#8217;s easy enough to confuse the two, but the UB is a whole other entry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the heat, dust, boredom at the border, and the dining car running out of food, I have to say that we did very well on carriage-mates. We met an English couple named Sam &amp;#038; Dave on the platform in Beijing and as luck would have it they were our Carriage mates on the train, and great company. They&amp;#8217;re taking the train all the way down the line to St. Petersburg, good on &amp;#8216;em I say. Their good humor made the trip much more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Camera Karma</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/camera-karma.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/camera-karma</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should have burned the yak butter at the Buddhist Temple or made one more round with the prayer wheels because we have had some kind of bad luck when it comes to cameras on this trip. After our &lt;a title=&quot;Dude Where&#39;s Our Stuff?&quot; href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=64&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;misfortunes in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, we purchased another point and shoot digital camera to get us through until Hong Kong.  It wasn&amp;#8217;t quite as nice as the one I had, but a camera no less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Hong Kong, we hit the streets in search of a good deal on a new digital SLR.  After visiting many, many camera shops, we finally found a Nikon D50, the same model that was stolen.  We paid up and as we waited for them to allegedly box up our purchase, we somehow got lured into a conversation with another guy in the shop who after much discussion somehow had us buying a newer model Canon with a big old lens instead of two separate lenses.  He bigged us up just like at McDonald&amp;#8217;s.  I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure they&amp;#8217;ve done this before.  We learned a lot, we bargained hard and we &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have gotten an ok deal.  In the end, we had two working cameras again as we made our way into mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since that time, my little digital camera has decided not to work, then to work and then not to work again.  Really it still takes photos and video, but the zoom and no other functions work.  And well, sadly, the new SLR had a bit of a spill back at Tiger Leaping Gorge and hasn&amp;#8217;t been the same since.  Fortunately, it&amp;#8217;s just the lens and not the camera, but still.  Big bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s possible that our camera karma may be improving. Yesterday we found a shop in Beijing that appeared to understand what the problems are and agreed to fix both on short order.  Hopefully, we&amp;#8217;ll pick them up later today and head to Mongolia tomorrow with two working cameras again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed, yak butter burning, prayer wheels spinning! &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things to Do in Beijing</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/being-in-beijing.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/being-in-beijing</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have to admit &amp;#8211; we probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t even do an entry on Beijing until we go back there next month. Our three nights and two days there on this leg were mainly occupied with chores: picking up tickets from the travel agency, finding a camera shop to repair our busted equipment, trying to make a few changes to our airline tickets and doing laundry. Not exactly blog-worth material, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t blame you if you stopped reading right here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is &amp;#8211; surprise &amp;#8211; a huge city. And everything happening there right now revolves around making sure that the facilities for the Olympics next year are done way ahead of time. The Chinese don&amp;#8217;t want another &amp;#8220;Athens&amp;#8221; happening on their watch. There are billboards around making sure no one forgets it either &amp;#8211; one counts down the days until the games begin. There are reports on the news promoting how many stadiums are done, how many days ahead of schedule they are and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still, most of this is material for a future blog entry when we actually do something in Beijing beyond our laundry. The only real drama this time around was what has become known between LeeAnne and I as &amp;#8220;The Qantas Affair&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re at a point in our trip where we are over half way done, and we&amp;#8217;re ready to make a few tweaks to our itinerary. A few date changes and a few destination changes. After looking long and hard at Mauritius, we just can&amp;#8217;t find a place to stay for a reasonable amount of money, so we&amp;#8217;re going to ditch it and trade those flights for flights from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls. Also, we&amp;#8217;re hoping to change our flight from Nairobi to London to a flight from Johannesburg to London, it&amp;#8217;s just going to be a lot easier. That is, if we can get &amp;#8216;er done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QANTAS we are quickly learning stands for &amp;#8220;Queer And Nasty Try Another Service&amp;#8221;. Actually, that&amp;#8217;s too harsh, we&amp;#8217;ve used them to make ticket changes on this trip already and everything went fine, but the Beijing office is a cause for alarm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people behind the desk in Beijing have no experience with the One World ticket, didn&amp;#8217;t know how to make any changes and apparently don&amp;#8217;t know where Victoria Falls, Zambia, or Namibia are, much less what their airport codes are. By the time we left the office, I was actually glad to have nothing done and our paper tickets to Mauritius safely in our hands. First, do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So nothing may come from our visit to QANTAS in Beijing, but we still have opportunities to make changes in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Jo&amp;#8217;Berg. We have to draw a high card in one of those cities. Wish us luck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shaolin Temple</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/shaolin-temple.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/shaolin-temple</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What can I say &amp;#8211; Lonely Planet you got it wrong again! The LP entry on Shaolin kind of disses on it, making it seem like an over-touristed slock show. LeeAnne and I went in with very low expectations, but if you&amp;#8217;ve seen as many Kung-Fu movies as I have, going to China without visiting Shaolin Temple is like eating a peanut butter sandwich with no peanut butter. And we were greatly rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, getting to Shaolin is not exactly easy. It isn&amp;#8217;t the hardest to get to place we&amp;#8217;ve been in China, but it did require an overnight stay in a neighboring city we didn&amp;#8217;t particularly want to visit, a long bus ride, followed by short bus ride and some confusion over where in the heck to stay in the middle of bumkin-ville. All worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might have a different perspective on the whole thing if we had stayed in Zhongzheng or Dengfu and just made Shaolin a day trip. But we had heard there were a few guesthouses near the temple and if you wanted to you could actually spend the night at one of the Kung-Fu schools that dot the area. Luckily for us, when the bus dropped us off at Shaolin the we were directed by the locals to &amp;#8220;Darhma Hall&amp;#8221; located on the campus of a Wushu School with 7000 students between the ages of 7 and 18. That really made it worth it for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Temple itself has been destroyed several times and the most recent reconstruction dates only from the mid-eighties, so if you&amp;#8217;re looking for charming architecture this ain&amp;#8217;t it. The weather when we were there was crappy, so hiking in the hills around the temple (which is suppose to be very nice), wasn&amp;#8217;t an option. And Lonely Planet was right about one thing, there are a few too many Chinese tourists. Although the monks do put on a great Vegas inspired martial arts show in the auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight then was staying at the school. Even though we didn&amp;#8217;t participate in classes, we got a great look into the school just by being there and watching them practice. Nothing like spending the evening with 7,000 Kung-Fu bad-asses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also learned why China will rule the world. These kids were up at 5:30 practicing in the courtyards and after a day full of Kung-Fu, they were studying in school all night! We walked by one classroom at about 9PM on a Friday, and there they were studying their little Kung-Fu hearts out. I&amp;#8217;m not sure, but if I&amp;#8217;ve learned anything from Kung-Fu movies, I think they may also sleep on their heads. This place is just that hard core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lonely Planet, get it right next time &amp;#8211; Shaolin is worth the trip!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Tale of Toes and Terra Cotta Warriors &#8211; Xian</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/a-tale-of-toes-and-terra-cotta-warriors-xian.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/a-tale-of-toes-and-terra-cotta-warriors-xian</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Of the many, &amp;#8216;must see&amp;#8217; cities in China, Xi&amp;#8217;an is certainly high on the list.  It&amp;#8217;s considered one of the four great ancient capitals of China and is the eastern terminus of the old Silk Route.  Today, Xi&amp;#8217;an presents a good example of the contrasts of China.  Within the Ming era moated and walled city, are an ever growing number of modern high rises and fancy shopping malls where you can sit at Starbucks and sip your $3 latte while overlooking the Bell Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the tremendous find of local farmers digging their well back in 1974, most of us go to Xi&amp;#8217;an to visit the Terracotta Army.  It&amp;#8217;s one of a handful of places that everyone asks if we will see while in China and with very good reason.  Though there is still much work to be done excavating what&amp;#8217;s believed to be an army of 7000 warriors, it is still mighty impressive.  Every warrior is said to be distinct representing actual soldiers in the army of the Emperor of Qin. It supposedly took 700,000 workers 38 years to complete.  I&amp;#8217;m sure their labor practices were unquestionable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we&amp;#8217;ll fondly recall our visit to the Terracotta Warriors, Xi&amp;#8217;an may be most memorable for our visit to the local hospital.  It seems I did something nasty to one of my toes while hiking Tiger Leaping Gorge.  At first it seemed like I just jammed it and might lose a toenail.  A little pain and inconvenience, but not a big deal.  But after two weeks of increased swelling, redness and pain, Dave suddenly became convinced that I was going to lose my toe unless I went to the doctor.  Since their was what appeared to be a small hospital just down the street from our hostel, I stubbornly agreed.  With our Mandarin phrasebook and laminated medical picture translator in hand, how could we go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that we spoke no Mandarin and the two doctors didn&amp;#8217;t speak any English made for an interesting encounter.  While I pointed one dr. toward the toe in question, showed him the characters for hiking in the book and attempted to indicate that it had been two weeks, Dave entertained the other dr. by pointing to pictures on the medical translator.  No Dave, please don&amp;#8217;t point to the enema!  No, you say it&amp;#8217;s not broken?  Good.  What, you want to give me an IV?  Vigorous shaking of the head.  No, definitely not necessary. After a drawn out didactic conversation that noone could really understand and a little poking of the toe, the dr. applied a liberal amount of mercurochrome, wrapped it up in gauze, instructed me not to wash it (I think) and prescribed two kinds of antibiotics.  Luckily, our trusty phrasebook includes key pharmaceutical questions such as &amp;#8220;how many times a day?&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this undivided attention, including that of most patients and nurses on the floor, and meds cost us a little over $2.  And amazingly enough, the toe has resumed looking like a toe and is no longer causing me pain.  That mercury is good stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mr. Wang &#038; The Giant Pandas</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/mr-wang-the-giant-pandas.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/mr-wang-the-giant-pandas</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For many travelers who venture beyond the East Coast of China, it seems that the city of Chengdu is a natural stopping point and with good reason. As capital of the Sichuan Province, it&amp;#8217;s a gateway to a number of great adventures and a popular jumping off point for Tibet. A day on the bus will take you through beautiful valleys to go horse trekking in Songpan or to trek up the popular Emei Shan, one of four famous Buddhist mountains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, Chengdu meant being back in the comfort of a pleasant youth hostel where we could take hot showers, watch DVDs, read an English menu, and wash clothes after many long bus rides. The city itself is large and modern with little by way of sites that interested us. Two exceptions were pandas and Mr. Wang&amp;#8217;s Tiny Museum. The latter we only heard of through our hostel when we arrived. When I asked if their was a Pinyin (as opposed to Chinese characters) version of the street name and whether or not it was difficult to find, the girl at reception said, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s hard to find and not very good. It&amp;#8217;s very small and you have to pay.&amp;#8221; Well, you have to pay to go to the toilet in China so that&amp;#8217;s hardly a deterrent. But something about the way she tried to discourage us like it was an embarrassment, made us believe that it&amp;#8217;s just the kind of thing we wanted to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, it wasn&amp;#8217;t easy to find, but it was well worth it. Mr. Wang has a wall to wall, ceiling to floor collection of Mao crap. You name it &amp;#8211; pictures, buttons, badges, posters, statues, books, hats. It&amp;#8217;s all there stuffed into a musty little room where he, his wife and his feisty cat live. Yeah, he fleeced us for some additional cash after he insisted that we take several pictures of him with his Mao collection, but it was still worth it. It&amp;#8217;s not every day you get to meet the Head of Mao Tse-tong&amp;#8217;s Medal Research Society!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chengdu is also the place to see those big black and white furry pandas. It was recommended that we visit the giant pandas at the Wolong Nature Reserve north of Chengdu rather than at the touristy Chengdu Panda Research Center, but sadly our time was limited so we had to opt for the touristy panda visit. I have to say that at first, I felt a little ripped off. I mean I can walk to the National Zoo at home and watch Tai Shan and Mei Xiang chomp on bamboo for free! My niece and I even went to their first birthday party and ate cake&amp;#8230;.for free! But alas, we&amp;#8217;re supporting much needed panda reproduction with our entry fee. And they are incredibly cute. Baby pandas rolling around on top of each other and lazing about with their big bellies full of bamboo. Some things really are worth paying for!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kanding Stopover</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/kanding-stopover.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/kanding-stopover</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have to say we really didn&amp;#8217;t really give Kanding a chance, we were only there one night before we moved on to Chengdu. If we had more time it probably would have been worth a day or two. Lonely Planet describes Kanding as a mixture of Tibetan and Han culture. Translation: it&amp;#8217;s an example of how the Han Chinese totally wipe out any signs of Tibetan culture, other than a few old people in traditional clothes. Han-ification is a slow but very steady process, and Kanding is a good place to witness older traditional buildings be replaced with charmless malls or recreations of traditional structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said the scenery here is very dramatic as you approach from the west. The town is set in a very narrow valley with steep mountains rising on either side, and a very fast moving river in the middle. Once again, Chinese scenery saves the day. There are rumors of there being good hiking around and I wish we had time to investigate these. There are also a number of crazy cliff drawings around the city. They&amp;#8217;re all Buddhist/Pagan figures drawn on shear cliff faces a few hundred feet off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing &amp;#8211; On our bus trip into town we passed about 200 military transports taking stuff to stations in Tibet. Han-ification doesn&amp;#8217;t happen all by itself you know.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Litang &#8211; Little Tibet</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/litang-little-tibet.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/litang-little-tibet</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So for various reasons (time and cost being the biggest two, hassle being another), we have chosen not to go to Tibet. Let me explain a little: there are now three ways to get to Tibet from China proper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overland by four wheel drive, it takes the better part of a week, is expensive and you may have to turn around if the roads are blocked by landslides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fly in from Beijing or Chengdu &amp;#8211; Less expensive, faster, but since Lhasa has become a &amp;#8220;destination&amp;#8221; for Chinese tourists it&amp;#8217;s lost some of it&amp;#8217;s charm, and you really need to get out into the country to &amp;#8220;feel the Tibetness&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the Train &amp;#8211; See number two, and it still takes three days from Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we decided a good alternative would be to explore some of the Tibeten Plateau without going into what the PRC government consider to be &amp;#8220;Tibet&amp;#8221;. Which you can now easily do in the western parts of Yunnan and Sichuan. After &amp;#8220;Shangri-La&amp;#8221;, a mildly Tibetan town, we headed up &amp;#8211; way up &amp;#8211; to Litang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litang may not be part of Tibet (any longer), but it certainly has more in common with Tibet than with Han China. This little town was the hometown of not one but two Dali Lamas (the 7th and 10th). It&amp;#8217;s the home of a lamasery commissioned by the 5th Dali Lama, it was heavily bombed when the PRC &amp;#8220;consolidated&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s control over Tibet, and oh yeah, it&amp;#8217;s at an elevation of about 13,000 feet! Higher than Lhasa (more about that later)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus ride into town was full of amazing scenery, it was also a little hair raising. We crossed over quite a few high peaks, at the top of each the bus driver would throw Tibetan prayer flags out the window and shout something in Tibetan. The highest of the peaks was completely covered in snow, and it&amp;#8217;s the middle of summer! BTW &amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t know what the top elevation is for using your iPod, but mine stopped working for the duration we were in Litang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town itself is located in a wide valley surrounded by high snow capped mountains, and populated by Tibetans, Khampa&amp;#8217;s and a few Han Chinese. It was only opened up to foreign visitors in 1999, so you still get quiet a few looks from some of the older residents unused to seeing us &amp;#8220;Foreign Devils&amp;#8221; up close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you visit Litang (and you should), please bring warm clothes and lots of them. The high temperature over the two days we were there was 51 degrees Fahrenheit, this is in mid-June! There was sleet falling as we ate supper our first night there. Seriously! Also, sunglasses are a must. The sun is blindingly bright up at that altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this, but you have to go, the old Tibetan part of town is terrific, the people are extremely friendly and the monks at the Lamasery are very friendly. The monks here are such a big part of the economy that there are several &amp;#8220;Monk Shops&amp;#8221; on the main drag selling only monk related items &amp;#8211; monk hats, monk robes, monk &amp;#8230;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Night in Xiencheng</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/one-night-in-xiencheng.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/one-night-in-xiencheng</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Xiencheng is a very nice little town in Southwest China with very little tourist traffic that you probably have never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in Xiencheng it&amp;#8217;s probably to overnight here waiting for a bus to take you to another town. Xiencheng is not so much a destination as it is a stopover. To get in or out of here you will have to cross over some scary mountains on crazy roads. Pray it doesn&amp;#8217;t rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you arrive don&amp;#8217;t worry about finding a room. The locals know when the daily buses arrive and will be waiting to offer you a room when you arrive. If for some unknown reason no one is there to invite you in, the only hotel registered to host foreign devils is right down the street from the bus station, you can&amp;#8217;t miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most rewarding thing to do here is to hike up to the monastery at the top of the town and have a look around. These monks don&amp;#8217;t see as many tourists as some so they&amp;#8217;re more interested in showing you around, and the place is surrounded by snowcapped peaks, and the monks have the best view in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One monk was especially interested in our Mandarin/English dictionary. We tried to get him to show us the &amp;#8220;secret&amp;#8221; Dali Lama room, but he insisted they didn&amp;#8217;t have one and the Pechin Lama was the best. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shangri-La&#8230;Not So Much</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/shangri-lanot-so-much.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/shangri-lanot-so-much</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just north of Tiger Leaping Gorge at the edge of the Tibetan plateau sits the town of Zhongdian &amp;#8211; recently renamed Shangri-La by the Chinese. It&amp;#8217;s Tibetan name is Gyeltang, but no one uses it. Go figure. The name change was inspired by the James Hilton novel, &lt;em&gt;The Lost Horizon&lt;/em&gt;, in hopes of spurring the tourist machine further north in the Yunnan Province. Unlike most Chinese cities which have been renamed to be more Chinese, this one is less so, but will surely sound better on a glossy brochure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lonely Planet describes Zhongdian as &amp;#8220;a bland Han Chinese town&amp;#8221; and we couldn&amp;#8217;t agree more. Most towns in China seem to be booming with construction. New stuff everywhere. Most of it not interesting or necessarily attractive. Once we were settled at a hostel, we set off to explore a bit of the Old Town. Sadly what we found was more new construction, apparently inspired by the success of the Lijiang Old Town. Not much old or Tibetan about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the tourist vibe, the Ganden Sumstelling Gompa outside of town was worth the visit and is apparently the most important in southwest China. And like most places we&amp;#8217;ve visited, if you&amp;#8217;re willing to hop on a bike you can explore interesting villages and scenery nearby. Unfortunately,the weather didn&amp;#8217;t cooperate so we missed out on that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhongdian is mostly useful as a base for organizing an overland journey west to Lhasa or for heading north through the mountains into the Sichuan Province and the Kham region of the Tibetan plateau. We were planning the latter, so Zhongdian proved a fine place to camp out for a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you won&amp;#8217;t get much of a Tibetan vibe here, but you can get a darn good burrito! Thanks to Noah&amp;#8217;s Cafe for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tiger Leaping Gorge</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/tiger-leaping-gorge.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/tiger-leaping-gorge</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We just did a mini-trek at Tiger Leaping Gorge, it&amp;#8217;s in the western part of Yunnan and it&amp;#8217;s famous for being one of the steepest and most dramatic Gorges in the world. I have to say, it&amp;#8217;s probably the highlight of China for us right now. No maddening crowds of Chinese tourists, great scenery and wonderful weather helped out plenty. We did the hike in two days but it could be done at a more relaxed pace in three or four days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received a second-hand copy of a hand drawn map from a British fellow in Lijiang the day before we set out. Every guesthouse on or near the trail distributes their own version of this map. On it you&amp;#8217;ll find helpful information like distances, hiking times, vague notions of where the trail goes, and the location of their guesthouse in large black magic-marker letters. All of them conflict with one another, and none are to scale. Still, they&amp;#8217;re somewhat helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hopped a bus to the trailhead in Qiaotou early the next morning. Our plan was to hike about two-thirds of the trail that day, finish early on the second day and get back to Lijiang by nightfall (I needed to apply for a Visa extension the following day). Most people choose to just take supplies to last them a few nights on the trail, and for those interested, there are a number of cafe&amp;#8217;s in Qiaotou that will hold your bags for you if you don&amp;#8217;t plan to go back to Lijiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of trails. The old &amp;#8220;low trail&amp;#8221; has now been made into a two lane road by the government (more about that later). So we took the &amp;#8220;High Trail&amp;#8221;, the first 10 km of which are famously tough. It&amp;#8217;s all up until you reach the &amp;#8220;28 Turns&amp;#8221;, from there it is straight up. The 28 Turns put a hurt on us and we quickly decided that I could still get my Visa extension if we took the first bus back to Lijiang on Friday instead of the last bus on Thursday. So in the end we hiked a little less than half-way the first day choosing to stay at the &amp;#8220;Tea Horse Guesthouse&amp;#8221; our first night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day went much better for the most part. It&amp;#8217;s mostly flat, with a few climbs and a few steep descents. One thing they don&amp;#8217;t put on the maps are the four waterfalls you have to walk through &amp;#8211; I said through &amp;#8211; not around or over, through. Each gave us a little pause. We made pretty good time to where the &amp;#8220;High Trail&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Low Trail&amp;#8221; meet. From there we could have arranged for a cab to come pick us up, but we chose to hike down to the river and take a ferry across the Yangtze, spend the night in the small town of Daju and hop on a bus the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big mistake! The climb down to the ferry was tougher than anything we had done yet at the gorge, the climb up the other side comical. Here&amp;#8217;s the thing: there are three Ferries. One, the &amp;#8220;Old Ferry&amp;#8221; no longer runs. There&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8220;Winter Ferry&amp;#8221; about 45 minutes down the &amp;#8220;Low Trail&amp;#8221; that we took. And the &amp;#8220;New Ferry&amp;#8221; about 10km on from there. No one told us about the Winter ferry. The English fellow we ran into gave us some vague idea of landmarks to look for to find the ferry, but he took the New Ferry. The very same landmarks lead us down the much steeper, scarier, and potentially deadly path to the Winter Ferry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That path was basically straight down the steepest part of the gorge, over loose rock and shear cliff-face, hurray! Luckily, the ferrymen on the other side saw us climbing down and came down to pick us up, we were their only fare that day. No one takes that path because it&amp;#8217;s too crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking us across, the kindly ferry operators offered to drive us to Daju for a modest fare. Then, after taking a look to see if there was anyone behind us, closed up shop (for the day) and drove us into town. Lord help any unlucky souls that went down that path after us expecting a ferry, because it wasn&amp;#8217;t going to come until the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the TLG, see it soon if you want to see it at all. The PRC government is planning a Three Gorges style Hydro-Electric Dam for that area. Remember that road, that use to be the &amp;#8220;Low Trail&amp;#8221; I mentioned before? It&amp;#8217;s the road that all the Dam construction traffic will use.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Firewall of China Strikes Again!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/the-great-firewall-of-china-strikes-again.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/the-great-firewall-of-china-strikes-again</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before we had arrived in mainland China we were aware that censorship was alive and well here. The televised news is little more than propaganda and access to other forms on information is limited. Many web-sites, several that we use regularly are blocked. Try looking at a detailed map of China on Google Maps &amp;#8211; it ain&amp;#8217;t gonna happen, at least not from here in the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel sites are especially hard hit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.travellerspoint.com&quot;&gt;travellerspoint.com&lt;/a&gt; is on-again, off-again. The web- site for our round the world tickets &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneworld.com&quot;&gt;oneworld.com&lt;/a&gt; hasn&amp;#8217;t come up for use since we left Hong Kong. And now this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sophiesworld.cn/?p=25&quot;&gt;Flickr Shamefully Blocked in China&lt;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, the photo sharing site we use to host our travel photography is now being blocked in China. So while we can still post photos to Flickr (for the moment), we can not see them, and therefor can&amp;#8217;t add them to our posts, tag them correctly, or throw them in our little sidebar to the right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#8217;t sure how long this will last. In the meantime if you want to see what we are seeing (and you aren&amp;#8217;t located in Mainland China), check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/lolo/collections/72157600010945846/&quot;&gt;Round the World Collection&lt;/a&gt; on Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Earthquakes, Orchestras and Pictograms</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/earthquakes-orchestras-and-pictograms.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/earthquakes-orchestras-and-pictograms</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the top 10 tourist sites in China is the World Heritage Site of Lijiang, a small town in the mountains of the Yunnan Province. It was ankle to elbow full of tourists, but that didn&amp;#8217;t stop us from enjoying the people and culture that abound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1996, an earthquake rocked Lijiang, leveling most of the more modern, concrete structures, but leaving in tact much of the original Naxi architecture. The Chinese took note and have rebuilt the city in the same style. The result is a quaint Old Town that meanders along the hillsides and canals of Lijiang. On a clear day all of this is set to the backdrop of the majestic Yulong Snow Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what really makes the city charming is the Naxi people &amp;#8211; one of the minority cultures that still exist in the southwest region of China. The Naxi are quite interesting for a number of reasons. First, they are matriarchal and continue to practice &amp;#8220;walking marriage&amp;#8221; where women choose their partners and pass their name on to their offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unique aspect of the Naxi culture is their use of Dongba script &amp;#8211; a series of pictograms. Like so much of the minority culture in China, the use of the language was either destroyed during the Cultural Revolution or discouraged in year&amp;#8217;s since an effort to nation build. Efforts are underway to revive the language today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Naxi orchestra is probably one of the most popular events in Lijiang. The orchestra is made up of elderly Naxi men playing various instruments. It dates from the Song Dynasty and is one of the few forms of minority music that continues to thrive today. And if you saunter down to Old Town in the evening, you can hear the gentlemen play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is over run with tourists, but for now that doesn&amp;#8217;t take away from the beauty of the local Naxi people. And the Naxi sandwich is pretty good too!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comrades and Capitalist Roaders</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/comrades-and-capitalist-roaders.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/comrades-and-capitalist-roaders</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If a picture is worth a thousand words, this one must be worth a thousand dollars. This is China today. New cars being sold at the foot of Chairman Mao while &amp;#8220;Life in the Fast Lane&amp;#8221; blasts from stereos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few decades ago in communist China it was good to be a &amp;#8220;comrade&amp;#8221;, an equal ally in the communist fight. Good comrades put party first and kept a sharp eye out for those left leaning &amp;#8220;capitalist roaders&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; people with bourgeois tendencies who might derail the communist fight. My how things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, comrade is used by gay males to refer to one another. (Homosexuality was removed from the official list of mental disorders in 2001, in case you were wondering.) And the capitalist roader is apparently no longer the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Mao remains a national hero, Deng Xiaoping&amp;#8217;s portrait also graces many walls. It was Deng who brought economic reform to the nation&amp;#8217;s various sectors, trying to maintain a balance between socialist values and market economy. In the early days, these reforms lifted millions out of poverty and made him a hero to many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deng famously said, &amp;#8220;to get rich is glorious&amp;#8221;, and many people in Chinese are getting quite rich. Unfortunately, as is the case with many economies, this rising tide is not lifting all boats. The egalitarian ideals of the Chairman are long gone and the gap between the &amp;#8220;haves&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;have nots&amp;#8221; is clearly widening. You can see poverty and Prada (the real Prada, not just a fake) on the same block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave and I are still trying to understand how exactly a &amp;#8220;socialist market economy&amp;#8221; works. Somewhere down the road, one of these will surely come out on top. And while the government continues to slowly loosen controls and become the latest darling of foreign investment, it seems to want to maintain tight control over all else &amp;#8211; including its people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>That Can Do Spirit!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/that-can-do-spirit.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/that-can-do-spirit</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we were in the early stages of planning our trip, I was only lukewarm to coming to China.  But then I began to read more, not just about the tourist sites, but also about the history of China and its people.  At Dave&amp;#8217;s suggestion, I read &amp;#8220;Wild Swans&amp;#8221; just before arriving here and became utterly fascinated with this country.  What three generations of women endured was mind boggling to me &amp;#8211; from foot binding to war and famine to constant fear of persecution during the cultural revolution. I realized I know very little about this country and was eager to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the brighter side of Chinese history &amp;#8211; with claims to have invented everything from the decimal system to paper money to soccer (some soccer fans disagree), their history includes more than a few major tragedies.  In the 20th century alone, more than 6 million Chineses died in floods, while the country suffered genocide and massive human loss during the Japanese invasion in the 30s and 40s.  A 1928 drought killed around 3 million people, and then there&amp;#8217;s possibly the most famine ever, under the pro-peasant leadership of Mao himself, when somewhere between 30 and 40 million people died &amp;#8211; though it&amp;#8217;s impossible to know the exact figures.  This is just a sampling of the suffering and loss that the Chinese have endured in the last century alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe all this tragedy has made the Chinese tough as nails or maybe it&amp;#8217;s the communist invoked sense of nationalism and discipline, but there seems to be no stopping the Chinese from moving forward today.  Whether it&amp;#8217;s completing the Olympic construction ahead of schedule or becoming a leading world exporter, there&amp;#8217;s a definite can do spirit coming from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: Another read I enjoyed before coming to China was Paul Theroux&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Riding the Iron Rooster&amp;#8221; where he spends a year riding trains around China in the mid 80s.  Perhaps my favorite line in the whole book is towards the end, when he&amp;#8217;s reflecting on his time in Tibet and says someting to the effect of, &amp;#8220;fortunately the Chinese will never be able to build a train to Tibet.&amp;#8221; Meaning the mountainous, inhospitable terrain of the Tibetan plateau would forbid it.  Apparently he forgot that the Chinese are keen inventors!  The Lhasa Express, complete with oxygen cars, was unveiled last year and already it has become impossible to book a ticket there &amp;#8211; unless of course you&amp;#8217;re with a Chinese tour group.  No worries. Additional lines are coming soon to various cities around the country.  Pretty soon you will be able to take a train from Hong Kong to Tibet. You can imagine what this might do to the Tibetan culture and environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marvels of rail and road don&amp;#8217;t stop there.  The Nankun Railway began rail services in 1999 after the Chinese built something like 300 bridges and tunnels through the beautiful mountainous terrain.  Now tourists like Dave and I can take a pleasant train journey while remote villages have access to fruits and vegetables that they may not have before.  And I suppose it&amp;#8217;s also helpful to the local mining industry too. The world runs on self-interest, and the Chinese are no exception. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I look into the faces of the Chinese people &amp;#8211; particularly the elderly &amp;#8211; I can&amp;#8217;t help but feel tremendous sympathy and respect for them for all they have endured.  At the same time, I see this massive growth machine pumping dollars and development into every corner of the country with questionable consideration of its impact.  I can only hope that the can do spirit won&amp;#8217;t result in another major tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The NBA&#8230; It&#8217;s Chan-Tastic!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/the-nba-its-chan-tastic.html"/>
        <updated>2007-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/the-nba-its-chan-tastic</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Move over Ping-Pong, make room for Basketball. The NBA is surprisingly huge here. After Soccer it&amp;#8217;s probably the biggest spectator sport in the country. The NBA play-offs are broadcast twice a day here, live at 8AM in the morning and then again at night, followed by a highlights show with Chinese talking heads summarizing the game. We were woken one morning by excited Chinese San Antonio Spurs fans cheering on Tim Duncan and crew a few doors down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And basketball has kind of a surprising poster-boy here, everyone knows Yao Ming, but the player with the most exposure in China right now is &amp;#8230;Shane Battier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Shan Bati-rrr (as it&amp;#8217;s pronounced here) is everywhere! His handsome mug is plastered over billboards, city buses and his commercials play on TV all the time. You&amp;#8217;d think this kid was the next Jordan the way China has embraced him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the obvious question: Why Shane Battier? Well, rather than take a B-List or C-List contract with Nike, Shane chose to sign an endorsement deal with &amp;#8220;Peak&amp;#8221; sportswear, a China based rival. Thus instant Superstardom for Shane &amp;#8211; in China.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/well-hello-dali</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dali is a beautiful city with mountains on one side and a picturesque lake on the other. It&amp;#8217;s an old walled city and unlike many of it&amp;#8217;s ilk it has not yet been totally changed by tourism. It&amp;#8217;s certainly one of the best cities we&amp;#8217;ve visited yet in China. But I can&amp;#8217;t talk too much about it in this entry. I was sick with a cold the entire time we were there and it&amp;#8217;s overshadowed by the fact that LeeAnne and I experienced our first earthquake here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, experienced may be a bit strong. It was in the middle of the night and we slept through it. But it was a 6.4 magnitude quake and it was really close so it still counts right? Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007dcbu.php&quot;&gt;details from the USGS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were fine, the Dali was unharmed, and in fact the first we heard of it was from our concerned Mothers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes From a Chinese Walmart</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/notes-from-a-chinese-walmart.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/notes-from-a-chinese-walmart</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure Sam Walton is spinning in his grave. The man who billed his store as &amp;#8220;All-American, and American Made&amp;#8221; now has a huge business in China, with All-Chinese made products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.yahoo.com/broadband#mvt=m&amp;amp;#038;q1=Longsheng,%20China&amp;amp;#038;trf=0&amp;amp;#038;lon=109.984131&amp;amp;#038;lat=25.809782&amp;amp;#038;mag=13&quot;&gt;Kunming&lt;/a&gt;, the capitol of Yunnan Province in the South-west of China, and our room is right around the corner from Yunnan&amp;#8217;s first Walmart &amp;#8230;how could we resist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, our trip to Walmart was eerie, everything is exactly the same, except better. There&amp;#8217;s someone at the from door to greet you, there are those silly Walmart &amp;#8220;happy faces&amp;#8221; on all the store advertisements. The workers wear the same uniforms, only the vests have the Walmart slogans in Chinese characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two biggest differences: Walmart workers here are all in a union (albeit a union that demands they work even harder, longer and more cheaply than even their American counterparts), and all the food at this Walmart was completely fresh &amp;#8211; We have now been to a Walmart that has a bakery on the premises, a butcher that lets you pick out your own cuts of meat, and fruits and vegetables that don&amp;#8217;t look like crap. Amazing, we owe it all to you Sam!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fresh, Really Fresh</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/fresh-really-fresh.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/fresh-really-fresh</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing you can&amp;#8217;t say about Chinese food is that it isn&amp;#8217;t fresh, no frozen peas need apply. As a way of demonstrating let me relate something that happened to LeeAnne and I just the other day on the way back to our room:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fine Sunday afternoon, we were walking down a busy street when a &amp;#8220;FLAP!&amp;#8221; a fish jumps in our way. We were walking past a restaurant that was so keen to demonstrate how fresh their food was, they let the ingredients meet you at the door. In this case a rather large fish jumped out of the kiddy pool he was being kept in to kind of say to us &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;Come on in, this place is great! Really, you should try the chicken!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fish are not the only things waiting for you at the door of many places &amp;#8211; ducks, chicken, snakes, rabbits, hermit crabs. If you had it as a childhood pet, you can have it for dinner here in China. Meats are not the only thing that&amp;#8217;s super-fresh, the fruit and veg you have here will probably have been up on a tree or in the ground not that long ago. The Chinese will not tolerate food that isn&amp;#8217;t fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is great for us, as we have very weak Chinese language skills we can just walk up to a lot of places and point at what we want and shake our heads at what we don&amp;#8217;t want. Green peppers &amp;#8211; nod, onions &amp;#8211; nod. Eel &amp;#8211; head-shake, pigeon &amp;#8211; head-shake. We&amp;#8217;re making it work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Early Reflections on China</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/early-reflections-on-china.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/early-reflections-on-china</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#8217;ve been in China for almost two weeks now and I have to say, sometimes I need to remind myself we&amp;#8217;re in the Third World. After two months in India, being here is &amp;#8230;refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say nothing of the fact that everything runs on time, let&amp;#8217;s not mention how there are clean streets and sidewalks to walk on, we don&amp;#8217;t need to discuss how when you get in a cab, you don&amp;#8217;t feel as though you are putting your life in the cabbies hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what we&amp;#8217;ve seen, and granted we&amp;#8217;ve only been here a little while, and all of that time has been in the more prosperous South, China has it&amp;#8217;s story straight. The buses here are better than any buses we&amp;#8217;ve been on during our whole trip (and way better than Greyhound), the trains are better than any other trains we&amp;#8217;ve been on, the roads are (when paved) awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is like the opposite of India in almost every way. At times I felt like everything in India was hard, except finding vegetarian food. In China, that&amp;#8217;s the only hard thing, everything else is easy. And I don&amp;#8217;t even speak the language here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, if this place is still considered the &amp;#8220;developing world&amp;#8221;, the developed world had better watch out! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, some people have kind of dogged on us because we&amp;#8217;ve come to China. Words like &amp;#8220;Authoritarian&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Repressive&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Free Tibet&amp;#8221; have been used. Some of these words we agree with ourselves. But we wanted to find out first hand what things were like, and so we&amp;#8217;re here. Besides, if you have an iPod, own a laptop, or have bought an article of clothing in the past several years, it was probably made here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Dragon&#8217;s Backbone</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/the-dragons-backbone.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/the-dragons-backbone</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From Yangshou, we headed back north through Guilin again and on to Longsheng &amp;#8211; our base for visiting the Longji Rice Terraces, also known as the Dragon&amp;#8217;s Backbone Rice Terraces. I&amp;#8217;d read a post online from another traveler that Yangshou was really too touristy (true) and that if you really wanted to see the people and countryside, you should head to Longji and the villages within. Once again, if you build it, they will come &amp;#8211; in droves. This seems to already be the case with Longji. The good news, like Yangshou, is that with a little effort you can beat the crowds and explore the beautiful country on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terraced rice fields are quite an amazing sight and make for a good day of hiking. The fields wind along the hillsides climbing to a height of 885m. They were first built in the Yuan Dynasty and completed in the Qing dynasty. The locals continue to farm these terraces today. Luckily we made it there before the tour buses (and there were many) so we passed only a handful of other tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did however acquire a gaggle of &amp;#8220;long hair&amp;#8221; women dressed in their traditional garb. We had seen a program about these women on some travel show about China. There&amp;#8217;s a village where all the women have incredibly long hair. We&amp;#8217;re talking Crystal Gale long hair, but these women tie it up on their head into a kind of a hair turban. When we reached one of the view points they began to follow us and say, &amp;#8220;Long Hair, Brushing, Photo.&amp;#8221; Apparently giving them some yuan to brush their hair for you while you take a photo is the thing to do. We passed, but these women were persistent and followed us as we hiked around to another view point. After Dave finally relented, giving them each a yuan and taking their photo (no brushing included), we lost two of them. But two more continued on trying to persuade us (I think) to visit their village with them. Eventually we lost another and were down to one. She was really starting to grow on me, but when we made our descent back to the village, she gave up and went in search of more cooperative tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like every other amazing place in China (at least so far in our travels), you can see the traditional villager co-existing alongside the opportunistic entrepreneur. The village of Ping An is in the center of the terraces, and despite being built on a steep hillside, is rapidly growing into a major tourist hub with hotels, bars, and cafes. I really think the locals should revisit their zoning laws! Yet after just a few minute walk into the terraces, you are passing local farmers bent over tending to their paddies. You have to wonder what they think of the long lines of tourists &amp;#8211; both Westerners and Chinese &amp;#8211; tramping along their winding flagstone paths to see the various view points. Will the children of these farmers want to continue farming or will they find it easier to serve up a Tsing Tao beer to the tourists who camp out in Ping An for an a &amp;#8220;night in the village&amp;#8221;? One thing is for sure. Someone will have to keep on farming or there won&amp;#8217;t be any tourists I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Li River Daze</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/li-river-daze.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/li-river-daze</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the &amp;#8220;must do&amp;#8221; activities in China is a cruise down the Li River from Guilin to the smaller city of Yangshou.  Like all good budget travelers we opted to join the Chinese tour.  You get the same beautiful scenery sans the English commentary, but for half the price of the Foreigner&amp;#8217;s tour.  And of course there is the extra bonus &amp;#8211; a cross-cultural experience with 60 Chinese tourists! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The river winds it way between the green limestone hills past small villages, terraced rice paddies and cormorant fishermen.  Not even the flotilla of 70 or more boats making the journey down the river can spoil the scenery. It&amp;#8217;s unlike any other we have seen &amp;#8211; simply stunning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than taking the return bus trip to Guilin, we decided to hang out for a few days in Yangshou &amp;#8211; a &amp;#8220;legendary backpacker hangout.&amp;#8221;  The city is just as other worldly as the natural beauty that surrounds it.  It&amp;#8217;s one of those places where we can take a vacation from your vacation.  Locals speak English, their are a multitude of food options, lodging is cheap and comfy and there is any number of outdoor activities to choose from.  At the same time, like so many other tourist locations in China (as we are quickly learning), there&amp;#8217;s plenty on hand for the Chinese tourists as well &amp;#8211; karaoke, mini basketball hoops, and loads of souvenir schlock.  The main pedestrian mall comes alive with tourists shuffling along buying knock off North Face jackets and Louis Vuitton hand bags while in the background there&amp;#8217;s a cacophony of off pitch Chinese karaoke singers, ABBA music, and traditional flute music.  The closest comparison we could draw was Bourbon Street &amp;#8211; substituting fake handbags and watches for booze. We call it the Disney effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were intrigued by this bizarre place, we weren&amp;#8217;t exactly in love with it.  But the real reason we decided to stay for a few days was to explore what lies beyond Yangshou.  Today we rented bikes and accompanied by a local guide pedaled through little villages and rice paddies taking in some more of the amazing scenery and local life, stopping off for a very steep hike (some 1250 steps &amp;#8211; though I didn&amp;#8217;t count them) up Moon Hill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the kind of day when I am feel in awe of this experience.  For the most part we escaped the masses and enjoyed a little bit of what China has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Land of Limestone Towers &#038; Caves &#8211; Guilin</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/land-of-limestone-towers-caves-gulin.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/land-of-limestone-towers-caves-gulin</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Guilin, it&amp;#8217;s just one of the many cities in China with over a million inhabitants that you have probably never heard of. It&amp;#8217;s also the first real stop for us in China (we spent a night in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.yahoo.com/broadband#q1=Canton,%20China&amp;amp;#038;trf=0&amp;amp;#038;lon=113.225098&amp;amp;#038;lat=23.14036&amp;amp;#038;mag=13&quot;&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; formerly known as Canton &amp;#8211; but that doesn&amp;#8217;t really count as we were just there long enough to sleep). It&amp;#8217;s also the first time in our almost five month trip that we haven&amp;#8217;t been in a former British Colony. It&amp;#8217;s something we&amp;#8217;ve caught ourselves on a few times already. I wonder who built that tunnel? Oh, of course, the Chinese!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guilin is located in Southwestern China, if you look at a map, it&amp;#8217;s in the bulge just above Vietnam. It&amp;#8217;s known all over for it&amp;#8217;s fantastic landscape. And I do mean fantastic, it looks like something straight out of the imagination of Tolkien. It&amp;#8217;s covered in a mist most of the day and there are huge limestone towers a few hundred meters high all over the place. The place is very green, with Bamboo and Banyan trees all over. As if that weren&amp;#8217;t enough, huge caves have been carved out of the limestone. It&amp;#8217;s one of the strangest landscapes we&amp;#8217;ve seen on our travels yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Southwest is populated by a large number of Ethnic minorities (AKA &amp;#8211; Not Han Chinese) and Guilin is kind of the center of things for them. One thing I will say for these folks, they will eat anything! A look at a menu in Southwest China, or a stroll through a market is &amp;#8230;enlightening. So far we have seen every kind of meat you can image and many you wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to: rats, snakes, eels, pigeon, snakes, frogs, turtles, day old pigs on a skewer. It is all eaten, and the locals claim it is all delicious! For a pair of vegetarians it can make dining out a bit troublesome, but we aren&amp;#8217;t complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/amen</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well it appears we&amp;#8217;ve succeeded at obtaining a legitimate 30 day visa for me in China.  While in Guilin, we visited the local Public Security Bureau to inquire about an extension.  Word among travelers is that they are quite pleasant to deal with and offer a relatively quick turn around.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure one week qualifies as a quick turn around, but they were certainly pleasant so I&amp;#8217;m not complaining. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked why I only had a 10 day visa I replied, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know.  It wasn&amp;#8217;t clear to me.&amp;#8221; Not a complete distortion of the truth.  I was a little nervous when the PSB officer looked me up in the system and then said a polite &amp;#8220;excuse me&amp;#8221; as she went to talk with a superior.  It all seemed too familiar.  But she returned with an ok. Yahoo! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From talking with other travelers &amp;#8211; all of whom seem to have 60 and 90 day visas! &amp;#8211; my situation seemed not very common.  Now I certainly know what NOT to include on my application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I still promise not to try to convert anyone while in China.   &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>High Road to China</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/the-high-road-to-china.html"/>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/the-high-road-to-china</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in! Well, almost &amp;#8230;we&amp;#8217;re crossing the border in a few hours, but LeeAnne was given a Visa. Just a ten day visa, but we&amp;#8217;re hoping to get an extension in-country. Barring that, we&amp;#8217;ll return to Hong Kong and reapply for a 30 day visa through a travel agency. We&amp;#8217;ve been told they may know what gears to grease, wink-wink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we&amp;#8217;re very excited. It&amp;#8217;s a big turn around from the day before yesterday, when things just were not going right for us. So hopefully, our next report to you will be from the other side of the border.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hong Kong Phooey</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/china/hong-kong-phooey.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/china/hong-kong-phooey</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have to say, after spending two months in India, there are few places better to go than Hong Kong. It&amp;#8217;s clean, super-modern and very comfortable. We&amp;#8217;re loving our time here, we&amp;#8217;re staying in Kowloon, which is kind of a tourist ghetto, but a Hong Kong tourist ghetto is a lot better than a Indian, or even Australian tourist ghetto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton a little shops and markets all over. We&amp;#8217;ve already done some of the more common Hong Kong activities &amp;#8211; bought a fake handbag, a fake watch and tomorrow we&amp;#8217;ll probably get a replacement for the camera that was stolen in Australia (hopefully not a fake). We almost had a copy of Spiderman 3 on DVD, but the cops showed up before we could close the deal so our vendor disappeared in no time flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#8217;s a good thing we like it here so much, because we may be here a while. We applied for our Chinese Visas yesterday and it may be that LeeAnne can&amp;#8217;t go. When we filled out our applications we made a few, let&amp;#8217;s call them mis-steps:&lt;br&gt;
1) We applied for &amp;#8220;double entry&amp;#8221; visas &amp;#8211; and right now the Peoples Republic is not giving Americans double entry visas.&lt;br&gt;
2) Rather than put down &amp;#8220;Unemployed&amp;#8221; as our job title and &amp;#8220;None&amp;#8221; under our employers name, we put our previous job titles and employers names. This worked like a charm for me, unfortunately, the Visa Officer asked LeeAnne to spell out what the acronym USCCB stood for. Of course the full name of her previous employer is: The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Catholic is a bad word in the PRC Visa Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we had to take our paperwork out of the Kowloon Visa office and go straight to the PRC Embassy. And after explaining to the staff there that she didn&amp;#8217;t work at the Conference any more, and wasn&amp;#8217;t even Catholic. They said that if she included a written statement saying that she wouldn&amp;#8217;t participate in any religious activities, or try to find a job, they would let her apply for a 10 day Visa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten days! I can apply for a 30 day visa with no questions asked. And we were planning to spend something like 60 days in China, so this may throw a huge wrench into our plans. But it&amp;#8217;s not our country, and I guess they can let in who they want for however long they want. Still, it&amp;#8217;s a bummer. We will get the verdict tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>India Notes for Budget Travelers</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/india-notes-for-budget-travelers.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/india-notes-for-budget-travelers</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;India is a budget traveler&amp;#8217;s dream. It&amp;#8217;s certainly one of the cheapest countries on our itinerary. Our daily budget for two is probably less than you spent the last time you went out to dinner. For the most part we&amp;#8217;ve stuck to it, though we did quickly realize that slight upgrades in train travel, for instance, were worth the additional expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our budget breakers were few and far between, but here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;Train Travel&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; Personally, we found trains to be much better value for long distance travel than buses. Most backpackers opt for &amp;#8220;sleeper class&amp;#8221; which gives you a berth that in theory you don&amp;#8217;t have to share with anyone else and you can lay down if you choose. We took this our first trip and were miserably hot and dirty at the end of our 10 hour journey. We resolved to spend about 3x as much for the comfort of AC. Though it would tip is over budget, it was worth it for we later learned that the difference is not just in having AC, but also in preserving some sanity. No one without a ticket boards the AC car. In contrast, EVERYONE seems to board the sleeper class car &amp;#8211; that is until they get into a series of arguments with other passengers who actually have seats and ultimately with the conductor in the middle of the night and get thrown out to the hallway of the carriage where they proceed to camp out on the floor. Neither of us cared to repeat that trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;Accommodation&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; I hate to beat a dead horse, but it&amp;#8217;s hot here. And when you&amp;#8217;re walking around like a stupid tourist in 110 degree heat for hours, it&amp;#8217;s nice to have some place cool to retreat to. In the humid south, we couldn&amp;#8217;t find an AC room. Up north, thankfully, it is a bit easier, but also more expensive. We include this additional expense in the &amp;#8220;sanity category&amp;#8221; with the upgraded train travel. It&amp;#8217;s worth it, and didn&amp;#8217;t really push us more than a few dollars over. Mumbai is the exception. All lodging is expensive here, though this time around we found a good deal two floors below the Lonely Planet recommendation. The only downside is that it only has shared squat toilets down the hall. For the comfort of AC, I can sacrifice the toilet. And if I really need to take a seat, I&amp;#8217;ll walk two blocks down the street to the 5 Star Taj Hotel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;Food&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; If you enjoy the local food like we do, there is really no need to break the budget on food. Major cities and tourist oriented destinations like Palolem definitely charge the gringo price, but the food is still relatively reasonable. Of course, if you want to break the bank, there are places that will help you do so. We probably spent between $3-6 on a meal for both of us. A good masala dosa never costs more than a 50 cents to a dollar at a respectable local eatery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;Tourist Attractions&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; We are tourists and there are things in India worth seeing, such as the Taj Mahal. Though the entry fees are still small relative to what you might pay in the U.S. or Europe, they would easily equal 1/3 to 1/2 of our daily budget. The frustrating thing (though I suppose you make an argument that it&amp;#8217;s fair) is that Indians usually pay 10 rupees (about 25 cents) for entry into an historical site, while foreign nationals pay at least 250 rupees, which is now equivalent to about $6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;Telephone&lt;/u&gt;- We ended up buying a local SIM in Goa which had pretty decent rates to call the U.S. Unfortunately once we left Goa, we had increased service fees and received fewer minutes for our value. Still, the calls were better value than the SIM we brought from the states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;u&gt;Email&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; Keeping up with email and the blog is our connection to home and something we enjoy doing a few times a week. We&amp;#8217;ve had great access throughout most of the country and for the most part, it has been inexpensive costing on on average about $1 per hour. If we&amp;#8217;re uploading pictures, blogging, catching up on email, etc, we can pretty easily kill several hours in an internet cafe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All told these are really not that hard on the budget, but at the end of the day they did push us over by a few dollars. Though we&amp;#8217;ve managed to get by on $30-35 per day for both of us, that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that you can&amp;#8217;t spend several thousand dollars a day for palatial luxury at a place like Udaivilas in Udaipur. The Kohinoor Suite with private pool has a modest price tag of $3800 per night at peak times. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Back to Mumbai &#8211; Indian Wrap Up</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/back-to-mumbai-indian-wrap-up.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/back-to-mumbai-indian-wrap-up</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re back in Mumbai awaiting our flight out of India. Driving in from the train station it was hard to recognize the town as the big dirty smelly place that shocked us when we flew in two months ago. The crowds didn&amp;#8217;t seem as overcrowded, the pollution didn&amp;#8217;t seem to affect us as bad and the beggars didn&amp;#8217;t seem to beg as much as they did. We went for a walk down at Chowpatty Beach last night, people were out socializing, speed-walking, walking their dogs &amp;#8230;how did we not find this the last time we were in town? Mumbai certainly hadn&amp;#8217;t changed this much in two months had it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not, but after tramping around the country our expectations of what to expect from a large Indian city certainly had. We were a little shell-shocked upon our arrival in India. I&amp;#8217;d never been to the third world before, and it had been a decade since LeeAnne had spent much time in a developing country. Now, we&amp;#8217;ve come to expect dirt, noise and pollution. People staring at you, or expecting you to give them money are everyday events. We are use to it. Given some of the places we plan to go this may be a good adjustment, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure about that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still if you travel to get yourself out of your &amp;#8220;comfort zone&amp;#8221; India is a good place to start. And it hasn&amp;#8217;t been challenging the whole time. Goa and Kerala are very relaxing, easy to travel and on the whole comfortable places. The people are terrific. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up north, things do get a bit more hectic, but you have to go for the sites: the things you picture in your mind are here, and you just haven&amp;#8217;t seen the Indianess in India unless you&amp;#8217;ve spent some time in Rajasthan and the UP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love it or hate it you, India will generate a reaction from you, and the only way to figure out which way you&amp;#8217;ll fall is to come here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/ellora-ajanta</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we were making plans for our final week in India, we really wanted to find a way to visit the caves at Ellora and Ajanta &amp;#8211; World Heritage Sites located in the state of Maharashtra. Until now, we have had it pretty easy always finding a direct train or bus to take us from place to place. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;#8217;t so simple to get from Udaipur to Aurangabad &amp;#8211; our base for visiting the caves. As Dave likes to say, we had to go around our elbow to get there, first taking a 6 hour bus trip to Ahmedabad, then spending the night and organizing transport onward to the caves for the following day. The latter turned out to be a 17 hour trip in the top sleeper bunk (more like a sardine can), over the rear wheel of an old bus with little (or no) suspension that all too frequently took detours down dirt roads. Though I wouldn&amp;#8217;t choose to repeat the journey, it was worth the trip around our elbow to visit the caves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30 caves of Ajanta are Buddhist temples and monasteries carved out of the rocky hillside overlooking a river (which was dry as a bone at the time of our visit). The caves were built from 200 BC t0 650 AD but were &amp;#8220;lost&amp;#8221; until the 1800s. Several of the paintings on the walls and ceilings of the caves are remarkably still in decent condition. Both the paintings and the sculptures at Ajanta are considered &amp;#8220;masterpieces of Buddhist religious art&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caves at Ellora were just beginning to be carved into he walls of a basalt cliff as those at Ajanta were being completed. Ellora&amp;#8217;s cave temples and monasteries represent Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism and are thought to demonstrate the religious tolerance of that time. Though they were all impressive, the awe inspiring highlight of Ellora is the Hindu Kailasa Temple. The view from the cliff above the temple offers perspective on the grand scale and ornate detail of the Temple. We tried to imagine what it was like to cut something so elaborate with a chisel and hammer and probably not see its completion in your lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wedding Crashers</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/wedding-crashers.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/wedding-crashers</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;embed style=&quot;width:400px; height:326px;&quot; id=&quot;VideoPlayback&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; src=&quot;http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-5723104614684803296&amp;#038;hl=en&quot; flashvars=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t take a Vince Vaughn scheme to crash a wedding in India, especially during wedding season. We actually had one gentleman befriend us on the streets of Udaipur to &amp;#8220;practice his English&amp;#8221; and subsequently invite us to his wedding party the following evening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s pretty common to stumble onto a wedding &amp;#8211; or at least part of the three day event &amp;#8211; in the streets. Actually, it&amp;#8217;s hard to miss the festivities with sound systems thumping on the back of a truck bed in the middle of the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our walk home from dinner one night in Aurangabad we came upon quite a little party in the street. The groom was decked out in traditional attire on horseback, while a few dozen young men were dancing in the streets ahead of him. They were all following a very noisy truck full of speakers playing wedding music. Dave pulled out the camera to capture some of the festivities, and within seconds several of the men picked him up and carried him into the middle of the &amp;#8220;dance&amp;#8221;. Here&amp;#8217;s the topsy turvy video to prove it! Unfortunately, I didn&amp;#8217;t have a second camera to capture Dave jumping up and down amid the sea of Indian guys.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Coming From? &#8211; Common India &#8220;Engrish&#8221;</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/coming-from-common-india-engrish.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/coming-from-common-india-engrish</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a few phrases that any visitor to India will become familiar with rapidly. Here&amp;#8217;s a quick run-down of common &amp;#8220;Engrish&amp;#8221; you&amp;#8217;ll come across:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming From? &amp;#8211; The most benign, they just want to know what country you&amp;#8217;re from. You&amp;#8217;ll get this from interested people in the country, cabbies and people that are generally interested in where these strange Westerners come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Pen? &amp;#8211; Carry a bag of US Pennies around India and you will instantly win friends among the countries youth. One Pen, or One Penny? is a common request for a coin from your home country. Almost always from the cutest little non-ragamuffin kids you&amp;#8217;d ever want to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pleez Maydamn, Pleez Seer&amp;#8230; &amp;#8211; Speaking of ragamuffins. This is the common cry of beggars, usually with one or more dirty children in town. Responding in any way is a form of encouragement to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come Shee My Schop? &amp;#8211; Walk down any street and you will be invited in to look at &amp;#8230;well crap. Usually a Shawl, Pashmina, or jewelry. For some reason, these are always directed to me instead of LeeAnne. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if that&amp;#8217;s because the think I wear the pants in the family or if &amp;#8230;well, let&amp;#8217;s move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Baksheesh? &amp;#8211; This will come from the guy in the museum that approached you, was a little too friendly, and knew a little too much about the exhibit. You may not know it, but he has decided that he is your guide, and you owe him a tip. Before you leave the exhibit, he wants his, it makes no matter that he approached you, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certainly many more, but I just wanted to give you a kind of top 5. Remember, bring Pennies &amp;#8211; make Friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Cult of Lonely Planet &#8211; Lodging in India</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/the-cult-of-lonely-planet-lodging-in-india.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/the-cult-of-lonely-planet-lodging-in-india</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our time in India is starting to wind down, so we would just like to pass on a few words about lodging here. We&amp;#8217;re using the latest edition of &amp;#8220;Lonely Planet &amp;#8211; India&amp;#8221; as our main guidebook and it&amp;#8217;s great of course, very well documented, written, and well thought out. The trouble is it&amp;#8217;s a bit too good. Every tourist here uses it and as a result everyone starts to visit the same sites, restaurants and hotels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel situation can be frustrating, because once a place gets in the book, it&amp;#8217;s like getting &amp;#8220;Made&amp;#8221; in the Mafia. They can do whatever they want, raise their prices, stop taking reservations, whatever; if you don&amp;#8217;t like it there will always be another tourist getting off the next train holding a Lonely Planet that tells them to go to hotels X, Y, or Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the trip, I never thought I&amp;#8217;d say this, but sometimes it&amp;#8217;s better to listen to the Touts at the Bus or Train station and check out the people they want to take you too. A perfect example for us was in Rishekesh. All the hotels that LP recommended were booked, all of them &amp;#8211; I have no idea what was going on &amp;#8211; so we ended up following a tout to a home stay a few doors down from where LP had sent us, and it was great! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy was just starting out, all the rooms were brand new and clean, it had a great bathroom and it was cheaper than anything Lonely Planet had recommended, we scored. Sometimes it pays to Zig when LP Zags. Rather than the overpriced room with no AC and a shared bathroom that Lonely Planet has recommended, sometimes you need to check out the place next door that has AC, is cheaper has a private shower and a staff that want to make you happy. Just because it&amp;#8217;s not in Lonely Planet doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily make it a hole in the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes From Octopussy&#8217;s Lair</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/notes-from-octopussys-lair.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/notes-from-octopussys-lair</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Udaipur is a great place to go if your extremely rich, or a fan of James Bond films. Actually, if your a fan of one James Bond film in particular: Octopussy. A large part of the film was shot here and even though it was released some 25 years ago, every restaurant in town still shows Octopussy every night at 7PM sharp. Before you are allowed to leave town, tourists have to show proof they have seen the movie. Workers in these restaurants can quote the film at the drop of the hat, and every rickshaw driver in town claims to have been in the movie: &amp;#8220;You see? I am in movie! Come I take you to Monsoon Palace at 5PM, yesh?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may exaggerate, you don&amp;#8217;t have to be super rich to visit, but it helps. Udaipur is called the &amp;#8220;Venice of The East&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s easy to understand why. The city is centered around a wide lake and many buildings are built right up to the waterline. The lake is home to the Lake Palace Hotel, once the home of the local Maharajah, it&amp;#8217;s now a 5 star hotel that hosts the likes of Madonna, Liz Hurley and other people with way too much money to spend on a hotel room in India. LeeAnne and I rode a paddle boat around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Octopussy and a 5 star hotel the city has several other draws: The City Palace is remarkable for it&amp;#8217;s ornate architecture and the fact it&amp;#8217;s a Palace in India and it&amp;#8217;s in really good shape. There are tons of art schools in town, so it&amp;#8217;s a great place to experience Rajasthani art. The Monsoon Palace has a terrific view of the lake, the valley and the city. And the Bagore-ki-Haveli is a great museum dedicated to the life&amp;#8217;s of the other half of the city &amp;#8211; normal Rajasthani&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you run out of things to do you can always sit on the rooftop cafe of your hotel (they all have one) and watch the locals have kite fights at dusk. It&amp;#8217;s a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Monkeyin&#8217; Around</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/monkeyin-around.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/monkeyin-around</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I guess it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be that surprising, but there are monkeys everywhere in India. We&amp;#8217;ve spotted a few in the wild, but most have been hanging around rooftops and historic forts. When Dave or I would spot monkeys on our safari in Corbett Reserve, all the locals just shrugged as if to say, &amp;#8220;just a monkey&amp;#8221;. I suppose monkeys here are like stray cats at home &amp;#8211; which of course we also love. We didn&amp;#8217;t care to take a picture of the largest wheeled cannon in the world (a $1 camera fee applied), but we took a half dozen or more pictures of monkeys loitering around the fort. If they don&amp;#8217;t already, the Indians must think we are pretty strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But monkeys are great fun. It&amp;#8217;s really fascinating to watch them interact, play, fight, pick each other&amp;#8217;s fleas and even scratch their dirty monkey bums. Of course, we haven&amp;#8217;t had the experience of having food snatched from our hand or worse, being bitten. As our Kiwi friends would say, monkeys are quite cheeky!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are quite the headache for some locals. Check out this &lt;a title=&quot;National Geo Video of Cheeky Monkeys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061003-monkey-video.html&quot;&gt;video of monkeys helping themselves to the local fruit stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caught a little video of our own at the Monkey Temple at Galta just outside of Jaipur. Despite not being loved by all, many Hindus do worship Hanuman &amp;#8211; a monkey deity renowned for his power, courage and faithful service. (video forthcoming)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pink City &#8211; Jaipur</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/pink-city-jaipur.html"/>
        <updated>2007-05-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/pink-city-jaipur</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rajasthan, in northwestern India, is kind of what I had always pictured India being like &amp;#8211; desert, lot&amp;#8217;s of castles and old forts, monkeys all over and people in Turbans. And so far it is not disappointing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in Jaipur, the Pink City, so named because all the buildings and the walls in the old city are painted pink. It&amp;#8217;s the capital of Rajasthan and it holds up to my expectations well. There are so many old forts and Palaces around here it&amp;#8217;s hard to keep track. It&amp;#8217;s also incredibly hot! It was over 105 every day we&amp;#8217;ve been here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to exploring the Pink City, we took a day tour out to the big sites outside of town: Jaigrah Fort and Naragrah Fort, visited the Monkey Temple on the edge of town and all the slightly creepy men that hang out there. And saw a Bollywood movie at the &amp;#8211; we are told &amp;#8211; world famous Raj Mandir Theater back in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaipur certainly exceeds expectations in most areas. The hotel we stayed at was by far the best place we have stayed on this trip, the Hotel Pearl Palace was fantastic (and not just because of the free internet).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Queen of the Hills</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/queen-of-the-hills.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/queen-of-the-hills</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After our relaxing time in Rishikesh, we were still longing for some cooler temperatures so we made our way further north to Mussoorie, also known as the Queen of the Hill Stations. It certainly lives up to its name. Located at 200m in the foothills of the Himalayas, the temperatures are quite pleasant, and there are a handful of walks you can do with little to no traffic. Even we found this hard to believe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to enjoying long walks without fear of heat exhaustion, we enjoyed the carnival like atmosphere of Mussoorie. You can take a cable car to a high point on the hills, ride a horse down the promenade, take a spin on a ferris wheel, learn magic tricks (pretty good ones too!), eat fresh masala spiced popcorn and soft serve ice cream and dress up in traditional Garwali costume &amp;#8211; which of course we couldn&amp;#8217;t resist. There is even a roller skating rink and a few snooker parlors. I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether it&amp;#8217;s the cool air or the soft serve, but everyone seems to be having fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like all hill stations, Mussoorie is full of cute honeymooners that are easy to spot. The women are typically dressed in the best salwar kameez, decked out with lots of shiny bangles and with traces of elaborate mendi (henna) designs on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few of My Favorite Things</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/a-few-of-my-favorite-things.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/a-few-of-my-favorite-things</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During our time in India, I have been making a list of my favorite things. Not surprisingly, most of them are food related! But there are a few other things unique to India which have also won our hearts. So in no particular order, I give you the favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;u&gt;Lemon Soda&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; As simple as it sounds it&amp;#8217;s the best drink in town. Take the fresh juice of a lemon (a couple tablespoons worth) and add to it icy cold, super carbonated soda water. You can order it sweet (Dave&amp;#8217;s preference) or salty, but I like it plain. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;u&gt;Mango Juice&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; It&amp;#8217;s mango season here and the fresh squeezed juice is unbelievable. I am a little cautious about where I drink fresh juice since some reportedly water the juice down (and not with bottled water). The best places serve you up pure juice. No sugar. No water. My absolute favorite was the little juice stand in Ft. Kochi by the Chinese fishing nets at the water&amp;#8217;s edge. And when the real thing isn&amp;#8217;t available, the bottled mango juice, Maaza, is a good second best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;u&gt;Magic Masala Chips&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; Masala is a blend of spices used in many Indian dishes. Much to our snacking pleasure, Lay&amp;#8217;s makes potato chips seasoned with masala spice. Yum! And they are just about the spiciest thing we&amp;#8217;ve eaten in India. (It&amp;#8217;s surprising. Even when we ask for &amp;#8220;Indian spicy,&amp;#8221; the food just hasn&amp;#8217;t been that spicy. Though we&amp;#8217;ve met a few Europeans who would disagree!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;u&gt;Masala Dosa&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; Locals seem to enjoy asking us how we like the food. They are usually quite pleased to hear that we are vegetarians and have yet to find an Indian dish that we don&amp;#8217;t like. They also are curious what our favorite India food is. Tough decision. We both have definitely developed a new love for south Indian food (sorry Delhi Dhaba), but the real stand out has to be the masala dosa. For those of you unfamiliar, it&amp;#8217;s a fairly large, thin lentil and rice flour crepe that is rolled into what looks like a big tunnel on your plate. In the center is a mixture of potatoes and diced onions cooked with masala spice and if you desire other veg like tomatoes. It&amp;#8217;s served with sambar &amp;#8211; a broth made with tamarind, vegetables and spices &amp;#8211; as well as with a coconut chutney. It&amp;#8217;s popular for breakfast, but we like it for lunch or dinner. It&amp;#8217;s a great mix of flavors. Not too oily and not too filling. If you&amp;#8217;re in the DC area, we recommend trying a dosa at Udupi Palace in Silver Spring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;u&gt;Hill Stations&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; No, not a food related item, but our appetite certainly improves when we cool off at 2000 meters. If you&amp;#8217;ve been following our blog than you&amp;#8217;ve probably gathered that we&amp;#8217;re hot almost 24/7. So whenever we hear there&amp;#8217;s a hill station nearby, we make the like the British and head for it. It&amp;#8217;s kind of like a vacation from our vacation where we can go on walks without sweating buckets and sleep with a blanket at night. What&amp;#8217;s more, the hill stations tend to have a carnival like nature. They&amp;#8217;re extremely popular with middle class Indian couples and families on little weekend get aways making for a happy crowds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;u&gt;The Head Bobble&lt;/u&gt; &amp;#8211; I first learned of the head bobble when Dave tried to convince a friend of ours (who will remain nameless) that she should waggle her head from side to side during a date with an Indian man she had been seeing. She really thought he was pulling her leg. But it turns out to be quite common and really endearing. It seems to mean &amp;#8220;ok&amp;#8221; when used as a nonverbal response, but sometimes I think it might mean, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not sure what this white person is asking me, but I guess ok.&amp;#8221; Either way, it&amp;#8217;s very catchy. I&amp;#8217;ve even noticed Dave bobbling more than once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/a-disclaimer.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/a-disclaimer</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With all of our frank musings about India, we realize that we might seem ethnocentric or judgemental to some. That is not our intention. And yes, we do like it here most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you travel through any developing country &amp;#8211; or any country that is just different from your own &amp;#8211; you&amp;#8217;re faced with all kinds of different experiences. We frequently struggle to understand and make sense of what we see. Here, in India, it is the absolute poverty of far too many and the way people seem to ignore their environment. In Australia it was the hidden presence of the Aboriginal people. This trip is not just about seeing the world, but trying to make sense of it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So understand that sometimes we might be sarcastic or a little too honest, but don&amp;#8217;t think that we don&amp;#8217;t enjoy our adventures. Our intention is to share with you what we ourselves find interesting and sometimes challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hippy Dippy Do &#8211; Rishikesh</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/hippy-dippy-do-rishikesh.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/hippy-dippy-do-rishikesh</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rishikesh is a smallish town set on the Ganges at the foothills of the Himalayas. In part due to it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;auspicious&amp;#8221; location it&amp;#8217;s a pilgrimage site for Hindus. But of late there are a lot of other people here besides Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being &amp;#8220;auspicious&amp;#8221; the location is gorgeous, the hills ascend up from the river dramatically with high banks on either side, in the middle there are a pair of pedestrian bridges that link the two sides of town, and there are Hindu Temples all around, it&amp;#8217;s quite picturesque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which begins to explain why since the mid-sixties westerners have been coming here in droves. You can blame it on The Beatles. They came here in their Maharishi phase (and wrote much of &amp;#8220;The White Album&amp;#8221; here), along with the Beach Boys and an assortment of Hollywood types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since word has gotten out about the place it seems it&amp;#8217;s been hard to keep the flow of Westerners away. And the folks here are pretty smart &amp;#8211; the over building that seems to happen in many Indian cities has been kept to a minimum, people are fairly respectful of you, even the Touts are almost polite as they try to sell you things you don&amp;#8217;t want or have no use for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LeeAnne and I have been here the better part of a week chilling out, doing some Yoga, and generally &amp;#8220;re-grouping&amp;#8221; (Re: Recovering from a cold in her case, and a nasty stomach something in my case). Luckily this is a very good place to do just this sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which may be why half of Israel is here. I swear, we&amp;#8217;ve had an opportunity to learn as much Hebrew as Hindi since our arrival &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s almost laughable. I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;m exaggerating when I say 8 out of 10 westerners in town are Israeli hippies. Before you say it &amp;#8211; I know, I know &amp;#8211; if you don&amp;#8217;t like hippies don&amp;#8217;t go to the greatest population center of hippies in India of all places, but here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the Yoga, let&amp;#8217;s say their idea of &amp;#8220;Beginners&amp;#8221; level classes here are not the same as ours in the States. In the second class the instructor started off the class by having people do headstands, you know, where you stand on your head!?! Half of the people in the class still had money-belts on. But surprisingly, some people pulled it off. I have now idea what the hospital bills were like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&#8220;Oh Dirty River&#8221;</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/oh-dirty-river.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/oh-dirty-river</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I stood at the edge of the Ganges in Rishikesh, I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but hum the final lyrics to Sleater Kinney&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Light Rail Coyote.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Oh Dirty River, Come Let Me In   *Except, I have no desire to dip into the Ganges.  Apparently I&amp;#8217;m not the same girl who once swam in the Rio Paraguay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ganges, or Ganga, is a major river in India.  It emerges from the Himalayas in the pilgrimage town of Haridwar not far from Rishikesh and flows southeasterly all the way to the Bay of Bengal.  For Hindus, the river is sacred.  Most believe that bathing in the river at certain times will wash away one&amp;#8217;s sins and help to attain salvation.  Many bring the ashes of their loved ones to the river with the belief that the ashes will be sent to heaven.  Though we only saw a few boxes and bags float by, it is apparently not uncommon to see dead cows or even people float by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself again at a crossroads of understanding.  This same holy river, a sacred burial site to some, also serves as a dumping ground for some major pollutants.  In addition to the estimated 1 billion liters of waste per day, there are apparently leather processing factories (does this seem ironic to anyone else?) which dump chromium and other chemicals into the river further downstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between this love of the river as a holy cremation site and the pollutants that are dumped into it, you can imagine my hesitation to join the ritual bathing along the steps of the river.  All this aside, it&amp;#8217;s still an attractive river at this point in the foothills of the Himalayas.  And there are plenty of rivers I would no longer swim in the U.S. too!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The World Cup (of Cricket)</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/the-world-cup-of-cricket.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/the-world-cup-of-cricket</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things we were excited about was being in India during the World Cup of Cricket. We arrived in Mumbai just a few days before the first match and were anticipating a huge outpouring of support for the national team from India&amp;#8217;s billion plus people. Sadly, India went out of the cup in the first round, so there was really little more than a whimper on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#8217;s still Cricket on TV, lot&amp;#8217;s of it! The World Cup goes on (much like the game itself) FOREVER! It&amp;#8217;s a two month tournament! So there&amp;#8217;s been plenty of opportunity for LeeAnne and I to learn a thing or two about the game, sadly we haven&amp;#8217;t. I have learned that Australia are very good. South Africa is good. And people in Pakistan value their Cricket highly (the Pakistani&amp;#8217;s coach was murdered after they were knocked out in the first round). Beyond that, not much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still there&amp;#8217;s plenty of games and commentary on the TV. There&amp;#8217;s also a surprising amount of Soccer on TV (thank God!). We had the chance to see a Liverpool game broadcast in Hindi, and we even caught highlights of DC United&amp;#8217;s game against Chivas in the Champions Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elephantitis: Corbett National Park</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/elephantitis-corbett-national-park.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/elephantitis-corbett-national-park</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Leaving Delhi, we set off for Corbett National Park about 250 km north in the state of Uttarchanal.  Our mission: elephant safari!  And maybe spot some other wildlife as well. We were partially successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We jumped a night train which arrived in the dusty little &amp;#8216;burg of Ramnagar at 6:30 am.  We found a place to catch a little more sleep and then set off to organize a safari into the park for the next morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a confusing and unhelpful conversation with a park office paper pusher &amp;#8211; which ended by him ignoring us to help some other people, we went back into the street to check out some of the private tour operators.  We popped into an office advertising &amp;#8220;jeep safari&amp;#8221; and our much sought after &amp;#8220;elephant safari.&amp;#8221;  We received about the same level of helpfulness and enthusiasm from the private operator as we did from the park office.  Apparently private operators are more interested in multiple day safari packages into the park, than a day trip like we were after.  We would have to organize the permits with the park office ourself and then of course there is no guarantee of an elephant safari since it&amp;#8217;s first come first served.  Unless of course you want to use our private elephant (chained to some tree likely) which will cost 2000 rupees (about 10 times the park price).  The tour operator finishes his lackluster presentation of our options by saying, &amp;#8220;First thing.  You get permit.  Then you can use whichever jeep you want.  You can hire from us or someone else.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter.&amp;#8221; Oh vey!  What a headache! Where were the annoying, nagging touts who really wanted to sell us something when we needed them? !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we wander back across the street, wait for the end of chai break (does it ever really end?), and revisit our options with one of the park office staff.  Frustrated, confused and beaten, we sign up for the park conducted tour that runs in an open tank like jeep that holds up to 16 people.  Logically you don&amp;#8217;t have the option of an elephant safari with the park tour(?), but we were tired too care.  Our decision was straighforward, affordable and easy.  No chance in hell we&amp;#8217;ll see any animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we were wrong. Though the tiger continues to elude us, we had great fun watching two herds of elephants  from just a short distance.  The second group (of which the video is more exciting but unfortunately too long to post) was at least 20.  Once the driver turned off the jeep, we could hear the pachys breathing, chomping on leaves and calling to one another from across the road &amp;#8211; perhaps a warning of the interlopers  nearby. It was pretty fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to elephants, we also saw many colorful peacocks, spotted deer, sambar, barking deer, a brown fish owl, a jackal, wild boar, monkeys (which noone here seems to really care about since they are everywhere), a hawk eagle and many, many other birds that our guide failed to identify.  It was no thanks to the park guide that we saw most of the wildlife.  Credit should go to one of the guys in our group and the driver &amp;#8211; both of whom had keen eyes for spotting the wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So despite our lack of elephant safari we had a very pleasant day in Corbett.  We haven&amp;#8217;t given up hope yet.  We&amp;#8217;ve heard rumors of elephant safaris at a park not far from where we are now.  Maybe, just maybe we&amp;#8217;ll get to ride an elephant yet. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mughal Mania</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/mughal-mania.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/mughal-mania</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During our time here in northern India, I have developed a particular fondness for the Mughals. Mughal is the Persian word for Mongol. The Mughals claim decendency from Genghis Khan and their empire ruled much of India and its surrounds during the 16th to 18th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were apparently superb warriors with a tendency to turn on their own kin. No blood thicker than power for them! What I like best about the Mughals is not their power-mongering, but their total lack of simplicity. Let&amp;#8217;s face it, if it weren&amp;#8217;t for them, Agra wouldn&amp;#8217;t even be on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mughals loved to do it up big and opulent. When someone dies, don&amp;#8217;t just mourn them and bury them. Build the most massive and magnificent mausoleum in the world &amp;#8211; the Taj Mahal. And if Shah Jahan hadn&amp;#8217;t been imprisoned by his own son in his palatial Agra Fort, he&amp;#8217;d have built himself an identical black marble mausoleum across the river so he could forever lie near his beloved Mumtaz. Since his dream never came to fruition, they are both buried under the Taj. (I asked Dave if he loved me so much that he would build me a Taj. He said yes, he would build me one out of popsicle sticks. That way he would get to eat pospcicle too! It&amp;#8217;s the thought that counts right?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Humayun&amp;#8217;s Tomb to Agra Fort, the Mughal architecture and history is fascinating. Though I have to say, Akbar proved to be not the brightest of the bunch when it came to building big (I can&amp;#8217;t claim the same for his rule.). He built the vast and elaborate walled city of Fatehpur Sikri near Agra with private residences for his three wives (a Hindu, Turkish Muslim and a Goan Christian) along with room for his 300 concubines, a library, a mosque, an artificial lake, beautiful gardens and much more. Unfortunately, he didn&amp;#8217;t do a proper assessment of water and since there was not enough, he later abandoned Fatehpur Sikri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remains of the Mughal Empire have been a definite highlight of our visit to north India &amp;#8211; or at least to Delhi and Agra. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good on ya Mughals!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Tail of One City: Agra</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/a-tail-of-one-city-agra.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/a-tail-of-one-city-agra</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It was the best of times and the worst of times.&amp;#8221; Mr. Dickens could have been been talking about one city in India, rather than two cities in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agra, a few hours outside of Delhi is a study in contrast. The city is home to three, count &amp;#8216;em, three World Heritage sites &amp;#8211; The Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri &amp;#8211; sounds like the place you&amp;#8217;d want to spend some time in, huh? You&amp;#8217;d be wrong, the modern city of Agra is a SuperFund site waiting to happen. Tons of heavy industry ring the city, it&amp;#8217;s up to it&amp;#8217;s ears in pollution and a nightmare to navigate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this, and it&amp;#8217;s still choked with tourists, and the touts, hacks, and beggars that tend to settle in heavily touristed areas &amp;#8211; so the locals you meet will generally be trying to sell you stuff you don&amp;#8217;t want, or trying to boost Rupees from you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why go? Come on, are you going to go to India and not come home with a photo of the Taj Mahal? I don&amp;#8217;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have to go, but it&amp;#8217;s a place you don&amp;#8217;t want to stay. Interesting statistic: The average tourist stay in Agra over the last ten years has gone from 15 hours to 6. Get in, and get out is the mantra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was ours too &amp;#8211; we did a pre-paid government run day tour of Agra. Leaving Delhi by train at 7AM and returning the same day at 10PM. We booked an air conditioned bus that would take us to the big three and get us back to the train on time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part it worked. The sights were pretty spectacular &amp;#8211; The Agra Fort was amazing, the Fatehpur Sikri has an amazing history and the Taj is the Taj, what can you say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I hate to say it, but go to Agra. But don&amp;#8217;t go to Agra.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Several Million Do Make A Difference</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/several-million-do-make-a-difference.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/several-million-do-make-a-difference</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a long, chilly train ride, we arrived in Delhi last Thursday. Delhi is India&amp;#8217;s second largest city after Mumbai. And though I can not find consistent population numbers, it is a fact that several million fewer people live here than in Mumbai. What&amp;#8217;s more, several million fewer people live in a much larger geographic area here in Delhi. The result: a city that we can manage &amp;#8211; most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, this is Delhi and we are in India. It&amp;#8217;s a city that manages to be modern and ancient at the same time. Strolling around Connaught Place on our first evening, we had a choice of many fine dining establishments to choose from &amp;#8211; as well as Pizza Hut, McDonald&amp;#8217;s, KFC and TGIFriday&amp;#8217;s, Subway, Ruby Tuesday&amp;#8217;s and Domino&amp;#8217;s. Few people pestered us to &amp;#8220;visit my shop&amp;#8221; or tried to swindle rupees out of us. We grabbed treats from Wenger&amp;#8217;s bakery and sat peacefully among the Indian couples and families watching the fountains in the park in the center of Connaught Place. I can deal with this, but then this wouldn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t fret. We&amp;#8217;re staying right in the middle of the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; fray in the Main Bazaar of Paharganj. It&amp;#8217;s Delhi&amp;#8217;s backpacker ghetto. You can find pretty decent budget accommodation and good internet connections. You can even drink a so so coffee and eat a cheese bagel (also so so, but still a treat). Aside from the refuge of our room, the internet cafes, and a few decent eateries, I find the rest of Paharganj verging on intolerable &amp;#8211; increasingly so after several days here. The narrow road of the Main Bazaar is jam packed with shops (mostly catering to foreigners), street vendors, trash grazing cows and the holy presents they leave behind, starving Delhi dogs, cycle and motor rickshaws trying to take you for a ride (more on that later) and swerving, horn honking motorcycles and cars. It&amp;#8217;s absolutely imperative that you keep an eye on your toes at all times so that they don&amp;#8217;t get stepped on, run over or doused with foul smelling fluids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Paharganj is just one little corner of Delhi. Delhi is in fact quite large and its sites are spread about making some form of transportation a necessity to see everything. In retrospect, we should have dished out a whopping $15 to hire a car for a day and be driven about in AC and take in all the sites without any hassle. But of course we didn&amp;#8217;t do that. Instead we honed our skills at negotiating, haggling and just plain arguing with auto rickshaw drivers every place we went. Oh, and we were really, really hot! Did I mention it has been over 100 degrees every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rickshaws are certainly cheap and handy, but their drivers here in Delhi are No. One at the tourist scam business. In addition to the, &amp;#8220;you like shopping? let me take you to a nice shop&amp;#8221; spiel, there is also the &amp;#8220;you have booking? I can take you to very good hotel&amp;#8221; where of course we would pay double the price and our driver would make a nice commission. Some of the scams are quite elaborate even involving third parties making phony calls to hotels. We didn&amp;#8217;t experience as much of this, thankfully. Whenever possible we would go to a pre-paid rickshaw booth where the price is fixed and shenanigans are fewer. But even then, we had drivers refuse to take us unless we paid double the fare. Once we got a handle on the distances and fares, we were able to drive a pretty hard bargain cutting some initial fare quotes by as much as 2/3. Even at that, these guys are making more money than if they used the meter. Oh how I long for a DC cabbie right now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the chaos of Paharganj and the ongoing overcharging and extortion of rupees by just about anyone selling anything to us, Delhi is full of enough amazing sites to please any tourist. After a day of errands (changing plane tickets, buying really cheap antimalarials, drinking really good coffee), we spent time at Sarojini Nagar Market where Dave had an authentic on the sidewalk haircut, visited Humuyan&amp;#8217;s Tomb, ate yummy cookies at Khan&amp;#8217;s Market, found a moment of peace at the Baha&amp;#8217;i Lotus Temple, cooled off in the shade at India Gate, marveled at the Red Fort in Old Delhi and visited birds on the mend at the Jain Bird Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first arrived, one of the men at our hotel said, &amp;#8220;two or three days is enough time in Delhi. very loud. very busy.&amp;#8221; I guess he was on to something. Delhi is a great place to visit. I highly recommend it. But after a few days here, it makes me want to curse at the people in the streets around me and clothesline honking drivers right off of their motorcycles with my arm. Completely inappropriate urges and emotions I haven&amp;#8217;t felt since we began our travels over three months ago. So to preserve our affections for India and its many splendors, we will shove off to hopefully cooler and slightly less chaotic pastures tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bazaar Haircut</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/bazaar-haircut.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/bazaar-haircut</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I needed a haircut some kind of bad. I haven&amp;#8217;t had my ears lowered since before Christmas. I&amp;#8217;d been holding out for some time, but the 110 degree heat in Delhi, combined with to opportunity to get a haircut on the street was too good to pass up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spotted this gentleman cutting hair when we went to the Sarojini Nagar Bazzar in South Delhi. I have to say he did an excellent job, but I still think I was over charged &amp;#8211; two dollars for a haircut, and 5 minute head massage, and the offer of a shave with a straight razor (which was politely declined) seems excessive. Especially because I drummed up so much business for him &amp;#8211; let me tell you, a white man getting a haircut on the street in India attracts a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he did a great job, especially considering I have no Hindi and he had no English. We had the shop-owner next door work a little translation for us &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;Long?&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Short?&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Ah, Medium!&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s some video of the head massage:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Holy Cow!</title>

        <updated>2007-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/holy-cow</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, so you may know that cows are considered sacred animals in the Hindu religion. Very little beef eating going on here. Even McDonald&amp;#8217;s has a sign stating &amp;#8220;No beef or beef products served here.&amp;#8221; (This is a surefire way to see a failed McDonald&amp;#8217;s in the midwest!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if in you&amp;#8217;re religion you had sacred animal, would you respect it, protect it, treat it like a deity&amp;#8230;.or let it roam the streets eating garbage? We haven&amp;#8217;t quite figured this one out. The sight of the urban, trash eating cow is not a pretty one, and yet it is all over India. We have seen some seemingly happy, grass munching country cows, but not many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#8217;t kill the cow and eat it. Just let it roam the street mangy, diseased and yearning for another hunk of dirty plastic. Perhaps we can seek some enlightenment on this subject during the remainder of our time here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Life on the Rajdhani Express</title>

        <updated>2007-04-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/life-on-the-rajdhani-express</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A forty two hour train ride isn&amp;#8217;t really something to be looked forward to. But after the better part of a month spent traveling further and further South, LeeAnne and I decided it was time to knock off a few of the &amp;#8220;Must Do&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; in India &amp;#8211; The Taj Mahal etc &amp;#8211; so we had to find a way from Trivandrum (near the southern tip of India) to Delhi (in the North of the country). It&amp;#8217;s a long way to go, but luckily we have time, so rather than bust the budget on a plane we took the train &amp;#8211; and splurged for Second Class Air Conditioned Sleeping cars &amp;#8211; well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a wide range of classes on Indian Railway trains. You can go First Class and have you&amp;#8217;re own bed and bathroom, second or third class and share a berth with 3 or 5 other people, or go all seater or bench class. In most of these there is another important difference &amp;#8211; you can choose to pay 4 times as much and go in an Air Conditioned car. The temperature in Delhi is topping out at 110 this week &amp;#8211; we chose the AC car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AC in our sleeper had two settings &amp;#8211; Cold and Arctic. On the second night of our journey both LeeAnne and I found ourselves sleeping under the very thick blankets provided by the staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do if you&amp;#8217;re on a train for 42 hours? Read, eat and sleep. Mostly eat. Because this train is so long and there are no stop-overs all the food is provided for you. If you decide to ride the Rajdhani Express you can expect to eat about 4 full meals a day and have tea at unexpected hours. I&amp;#8217;m sure we put on a few pounds on this train ride.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Three Nights in Thiruvananthapuram</title>

        <updated>2007-04-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/three-nights-in-thiruvananthapuram</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thiruvananthapuram: the small town with a really long name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as Trivandrum, the town elders decided to change the city name for brevity&amp;#8217;s sake to Thiruvananthapuram in 1991. We&amp;#8217;re in town for a few days waiting on a train to Delhi. I have to say, there isn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot else to do except wait on a train in this town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our train ride should be a blast! We&amp;#8217;re taking a train from Trivandrum (located at the very southern tip of India) to Delhi (Near the top). If we&amp;#8217;re lucky it will only take about 40 hours. We leave Tuesday evening and arrive in time for lunch on Thursday, awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trivandrum is an older city and you can tell: all of the side streets are a bit circuitous and it&amp;#8217;s easy to get turned around fast. Some time back they decided to make it a bit easier to navigate the city by putting in straight flat roads. It was a good idea, but poorly executed. The roads they put in were two lanes, one in each direction and were quickly swamped with traffic. Solution: widen the roads! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re in the process of doing that now, so the main drag of the city looks like a bomb hit it. They have a weird redevelopment process to say the least: if you home or business is far enough back, the city is only taking your front yard or parking lot. If your home or business is built right up to the road, you have to demolish the first set of rooms in the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a lot of buildings with the first room torn off of them and people setting up business in the rear rooms of the buildings. It&amp;#8217;s a strange site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect is that now, it&amp;#8217;s hard to get around the city on both the old winding roads and the new straight roads, beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any even, there are a few thing to do in town if you can get to them: there&amp;#8217;s a huge ornate Hindu temple, a wonderful beach a short distance away and you can go to a Keralan Martial Arts demonstration downtown for free. And of course, if your an urban planner, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of &amp;#8220;interesting&amp;#8221; decisions being made downtown. I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;s a case study here somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cruising The Kerala Backwaters</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/cruising-the-kerala-backwaters.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/cruising-the-kerala-backwaters</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A highlight for many travelers in Kerala is taking a leisurely cruise through the 900km network of waterways known as the backwaters. The waterways vary from narrow shady canals fringed with homes and rice paddies to large lakes filled with fishing boats. It&amp;#8217;s a relaxing experience that allows you to observe a small bit of local village life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first foray into the backwaters was with the locals. After a bus ride down from the Kumily and a very, very long wait, we caught the last ferry from Kottayam to Allepey, a hub for backwater travel. The 2 1/2 hour, 20 cent ferry ride set off just before sunset and travelled along many of the smaller waterways for most of the trip. Locals finishing work in the ride paddies boarded along the way, children splashed about in the water and women washed clothes along the banks of the canals. It was a pleasant introduction into the beautiful backwaters. And as a local woman said to me, &amp;#8220;Special boat 1000 rupees. Small boat 10 rupees. Same view.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s true there are a number of ways to enjoy the backwaters. One of the more indulgent ways is to rent a houseboat. These are old rice barges converted into luxury, private hotel rooms on the water. Since it&amp;#8217;s the off season, there&amp;#8217;s a chance that you can bargain the price down. Several Europeans we met recommended the houseboat experience. We were tentative since it was well outside of our budget, but after we saw one it just seemed a little too over the top or us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we took the 8 hour budget tourist cruise from Alleppey to Kollam stopping off for a no silverware thali lunch, a quick view of the Amma&amp;#8217;s (the Hugging Mother&amp;#8217;s) ashram (we opted not to stay), and an afternoon chai break. The cruise was lovely. It offered many hours of relaxation, a bit of breeze and the endless entertainment of many, many children running along the banks yelling &amp;#8220;Please Sir Gimme One Pen!&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; which actually means give me a penny. If you come to India, definitely bring a roll of pennies to offer as souvenirs for the cute little ones who will greet you with a cheery &amp;#8220;hello&amp;#8221; and most likely the request for a penny.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/gastrointestinal-update-no-1</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To appease our readers I will report that there have been no major gastrointestinal incidents in India as of yet. We are very careful about water, but have been enjoying a variety of local foods, juices (no water and no ice used) and veg (no lettuce) with little to no adverse result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they don&amp;#8217;t call it Delhi Belly for no reason at all! We&amp;#8217;ll see how we fare once we hit Delhi and beyond later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your concern! We made need it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kumily &#038; The Tiger Reserve</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/kumily-the-tiger-reserve.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/kumily-the-tiger-reserve</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a few days cooling off (literally in Munnar) we&amp;#8217;ve headed down south to Kumily which we&amp;#8217;ve used as a base to visit the Periyar Tiger Reserve. Count yourself extremely lucky if you see any tigers here. The reserve is huge and tigers are active mostly at night &amp;#8230;when the reserve is closed to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other activities in and around here though: LeeAnne and I did an early morning wildlife hike with a small group and a guide from the park. About this we have to be honest: aside from wild boar, and a few monkeys there wasn&amp;#8217;t that much wildlife to be seen, but it was still a good hike in some lovely country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumily is a big Spice town. All kinds: Cardamom, Clove, Tea, everything. There are several plantations outside of town that operate tours. There are also a few places that offer Elephant rides, which I&amp;#8217;m eager to do. We passed on the one in town that was heavy on the whips and chains approach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Homely Stay</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/a-homely-stay.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/a-homely-stay</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since arriving in India a little over three weeks ago, we&amp;#8217;ve run the gamut on lodging options. We&amp;#8217;ve stayed in overpriced, run down hotels, a rodent infested beach shack (Yes, we weren&amp;#8217;t the only ones sharing that great view!), and pleasant guesthouses run by local families. The latter is by far our first choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budget hotels in India, thus far, have tended to be institutional, a little (and sometimes a lot) run down and just plain spotty when it comes to cleanliness. Our hotel in Mumbai is the clear winner on crappy lodging. The room cost nearly twice that of any other lodging we have had, it had no windows (a good thing after our all night Bollywood film shoot), the AC was broken and we had to share a bath. Since we only had a private bathroom on two different occasions in New Zealand and Australia, we were pretty used to this set up. This bathroom, however, has a great deal to do with my sensory overload upon arriving in Mumbai. The smell of urine was so incredibly rancid I questioned whether I would be able to handle India. Thankfully, that bathroom has been the exception!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the budget spectrum is the guesthouse, also known as a home or homely stay. These are usually rooms in a family home run a little like a B&amp;#038;B in the states, but typically not with breakfast. Some have private baths and some shared baths. During our time in Kerala, we&amp;#8217;ve stayed in three different guesthouses and have had wonderful experiences at all of them. It&amp;#8217;s been a great way for us to meet locals and even some Indian families on holiday from other parts of the country. It&amp;#8217;s also a much more comfortable and personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Costa Gamma in Ft. Cochi, we talked with the owner and his family about a range of topics from the cultural and religious diversity of India to who his son&amp;#8217;s favorite wrestler is to the perennial favorite &amp;#8220;If no one like George Bush, how does he get elected?&amp;#8221; In Munnar, the owner shared a hand drawn map and guidance on some local hikes &amp;#8211; though we still managed to get lost. He also recommended a guesthouse for us in Kumily. There our host Sabu shuttled us to the national park at 6:30am ensuring that we made it into one of the trekking groups and made us a traditional Keralan breakfast (at no additional charge) which was delicious! All of our hosts were gracious and made us feel at home. A really good thing when you&amp;#8217;re living out of a backpack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#8217;re thinking of heading to Kerala for a visit, we highly recommend these places. Both the guesthouse in Ft. Cochi and Kumily are relatively new, so let&amp;#8217;s give them a boost!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Run For The Hills</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/run-for-the-hills.html"/>
        <updated>2007-04-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/run-for-the-hills</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, so technically we didn&amp;#8217;t run. We took a bus. An old, well worn bus that wound its way back and forth around seemingly endless switchbacks for the 130km trip from Kochi to Munnar. As you might expect, travel here does not take place at lightening speed. The trip took about 5 hours, and the bus was akin to the tin can I would take about 7 km to my site in Paraguay. Not something you would expect to travel on several hours. Nonetheless, we had a place to sit down with no persons or animals on top of us or squeezed in beside us. Oh, and it cost $1.60. I won&amp;#8217;t complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;ve probably gathered from our posts, it&amp;#8217;s rather steamy here. So much like the British back in the day, we were ready to head for the hills &amp;#8211; specifically the hill station of Munnar. The area is surrounded by surprisingly beautiful tea plantations. Munnar itself is somewhat of a company town. Though there are other estates in the area, Tata Tea seems to be the big daddy. The beautiful new school down the road bears a striking resemblance to the corporate headquarters of Tata Tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are handfuls of foreign tourists around, most of the tourists are Indians and the town is apparently especially popular with the honeymooners. It&amp;#8217;s been a learning experience for us. Today we took the Munnar Dept. of Tourism&amp;#8217;s Tea Valley Tour. Much to our surprise, we were in the minority. Aside from two Spanish women (which whom we would eventually commiserate), all the folks on the tour were Indians &amp;#8211; including at least one couple on their honeymoon. Fortunately, we were able to see some of the natural beauty of the area, but with every stop we were affronted by people trying to sell all kinds of random crap (like a stuffed florescent green monkey) or charge additional money for things we have no interest in doing (like riding in a speed boat around a lake for 15 minutes), though the locals certainly did. When the bouncing of the mini bus on the winding road and the honking horns of oncoming traffic weren&amp;#8217;t enough entertainment for us, we also had the never ending sample of ring tones from our fellow passengers. (They really, really love their ring tones.) I imagine they are still baffled as to why the we ditched along with the Spanish women before the last stop on the tour.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Forks for You</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/this-forks-for-you.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/this-forks-for-you</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m currently working on a theory about the relative prices of eating out here in India. After a couple of weeks here we&amp;#8217;ve been in big cities and small cities. Touristy places and less touristy places and we&amp;#8217;ve been trying to come up with an explanation of the wide range of cost on what is basically the same food. Here&amp;#8217;s my theory: If you get a fork, you just paid too much for your meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Indians eat with their fingers or whole hand (right hand only). They either dump their curry on top of rice and mash it all up before picking it up (Southern Indian Style), or scoop it up with bread (N. Indian Style). So the locals almost never use western utensils, and if you eat in a &amp;#8220;locals&amp;#8221; only type restaurant chances are you won&amp;#8217;t get a fork without asking for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, places that cater to tourists tastes (and budgets) will include a fork when you get you&amp;#8217;re food, and generally it will run a few dozen rupees extra to get exactly the same food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here for your pleasure is my over simplified formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 &amp;#8211; If you get a fork without asking for it &amp;#8211; You paid too much for your meal.&lt;br&gt;
2 &amp;#8211; If you ask for a fork and get one &amp;#8211; You may have paid too much for your food.&lt;br&gt;
3 &amp;#8211; If there are no forks to be had, and/or people are eating off of banana leaves (This will only happen in the South) &amp;#8211; Congratulations you scored a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hot Time in Kochi</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/hot-time-in-kochi.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/hot-time-in-kochi</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First off let me say we did not do Kochi justice. Kochi (formerly Cochin) needs to be seen in December or January &amp;#8211; before it gets too hot. In late March it&amp;#8217;s just too hot and too humid. Next time we will come in milder weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, heat and humidity have not kept scores of other explorers away from Kochi and it&amp;#8217;s easy to see why. Saint Thomas the Apostle came here to spread the gospel, after him Arab and Chinese and Jewish traders weren&amp;#8217;t far behind. The Portuguese, Dutch and English liked it so much they took turns running the place. All of these visitors left something behind too, so while the town is deceptively small, there&amp;#8217;s a lot to explore here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most striking physical reminders of these visitors are the cantilevered Chinese Fishing nets on the north side of town. They were a gift from the Emperor of China to Kochi about 700 years ago, and folks here are still using them these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St. Thomas &amp;#038; later the Portuguese left behind a lot of converts. A majority of residents here are Christian and there are a slew of old Churches in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LeeAnne and I also rented bikes and rode out to &amp;#8220;Jewtown&amp;#8221;. Seems there&amp;#8217;s been a Jewish community here in Kerala since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s a long time. All that really remains of the old Jewish Princely State now is a few geriatric Jewish folks, a Synagogue, and the name of this Neighborhood on the south side of town &amp;#8211; Jewtown. It&amp;#8217;s a unique place where Stars of David live in equality with the (Indian) Swastika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only complaint is the extreme heat and the dearth of Air Conditioning. Call me a lazy tourist, but I love me some AC. Next time we&amp;#8217;ll come in December.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>God&#8217;s Own Country</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/gods-own-country.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/gods-own-country</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No, we didn&amp;#8217;t come up with this, the State of Kerala did. Signs and brochures are quick to coin Kerala as God&amp;#8217;s country. I imagine much of this is due to its beautiful scenery, which in all honesty we haven&amp;#8217;t had the chance to see much of as of yet. For me, this phrase best describes the people, their history and their way of life. They look out for their own here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we decided to come this way was because, as I mentioned in an earlier post, it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;less crazy.&amp;#8221; So far this has held true. There was a woman from Kerala in my graduate school program at GWU. After she accompanied a group of students to Haiti over spring break, she dropped out of our program. She was overwhelmed by the poverty she saw there. I never could understand this. She was from India. But as Dave and are realizing India is a very big and very diverse country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerala is said to be one of the most progressive states in India. In the late 50s it was the first state in the world to elect a communist government. From what I understand they eventually fell out of favor with the hard liners in China, but their influence is quite visible here. There are many unions and cooperatives, a relatively equitable distribution of land and income, low infant mortality and the highest literacy rate in India (91%). Signs of education and job training abound &amp;#8211; including instruction for lady truck drivers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure there is still trash on the streets, but for the most part it&amp;#8217;s been swept into piles to be burned. Yesterday, we came across a &amp;#8220;plastic free zone.&amp;#8221; There are even places where you can fill your water bottle with potable water to avoid yet buying and throwing away yet another plastic bottle. And yes, there are even trash cans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave was beginning to worry when we&amp;#8217;d been here a day and no one had begged us for money. (A few, but not many, have since.) If you&amp;#8217;re interested, the well known book, The God of Small Things, is set in Kerala and offers a flavor of its culture and history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s quite an interesting place to be. A far, far cry from our experiences in Mumbai. For us, the only drawback so far is the heat. Let&amp;#8217;s say it&amp;#8217;s more like God&amp;#8217;s Own Oven! Note to those considering travel to India, DO NOT come during the hottest months of the year like we have very unwisely done!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scootin&#8217; Around</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/scootin-around.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/scootin-around</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just to make sure we didn&amp;#8217;t get totally bored of reading and relaxing on the beach all week, we decided to take a little day trip and see some sites beyond Palolem. We rented a scooter, bought a few liters of petrol and headed north. There aren&amp;#8217;t really that many sites nearby, but we made a day of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We scooted up and down the hills and along the fairly quiet rural roads passing small villages, rice paddies and school children along the way. Our first stop was Cabo de Rama, a huge old Portuguese fort. Despite the government signs warning of severe penalties for anyone caught desecrating this historic landmark, the place was pretty run down. We&amp;#8217;re not sure what &amp;#8220;protected site&amp;#8221; really means in India, but in this case it could only have meant stone walls speckled with graffiti and overgrown with weeds where locals put their cows to pasture and monkeys fly between the treetops. Still the fort was an impressive site (as were the monkeys!). It&amp;#8217;s massive walls wound along the coast offering great views of the Arabian Sea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We later visited Agonda Beach &amp;#8211; a smaller, quieter beach not far from Palolem. We knew when we came to India that our guidebook was dated (circa 2001), but our visits to Palolem and Agonda were absolute confirmations of this. It&amp;#8217;s true that Agonda is quieter than Palolem, but there are still many services and facilities &amp;#8211; many, many more than indicated five years ago. You get the sense that both beaches are headed towards some sort of environmental disaster in about ten years if they keep pace. Let&amp;#8217;s just say the view of the ocean is great, but the trash swimming along side you &amp;#8211; not so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kill time before the train station window opened up for us to purchase a ticket, we thought we&amp;#8217;d pay a visit to the Grand Resort Goa, an Intercontinental Hotel nearby. I had heard that you could pay to use their very nice pool and spa. We found the hotel &amp;#8211; a luxury fortress with closed gates. Despite our sweaty attire and mode of transportation, the guards at the gate let us pass. We parked the scooter and wandered about the resort. It was quite amazing &amp;#8211; private beach, golf course, archery range, skeet shooting range, heliport &amp;#8230;and pool. The pool, complete with waterfall and swim up bar, beckoned. We were hot. It was clean. We kind of look like we belong, right? I mean we don&amp;#8217;t have dreads or anything. We found a little corner to set our things down and took a dip. Refreshing, clean water. Things were going pretty well until the nice pool guy checked us out and realized we didn&amp;#8217;t check out. Being the honest folks that we are (and since they had a crash proof pool system), we fessed up and said we&amp;#8217;d leave rather than pay some ridiculous amount of rupees to stay. We already got to swim anyway right? I did offer him baksheesh &amp;#8211; a bribe common anticipated anywhere else in this country, but not with the honest staff of the Intercontinental. I am sure we weren&amp;#8217;t the first to offer. We calmly made for the exit, and relished our mini dip into luxury as we returned to Palolem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Papers Please</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/papers-please.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/papers-please</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the more frustrating things here in India has been the India love affair with red tape. Fair warning to all those who come to visit: memorize your passport number. You will need to produce it at many (unexpected)turns. Like buying a train ticket, or booking a room in a hotel, or &amp;#8211; most frustrating &amp;#8211; getting online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing your passport number at the train station is really just the tip of the iceberg. We also had to provide our home addresses in the US, our addresses in India and our ages &amp;#8230;to get on the train!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booking a room at a hotel can also be challenging: at one establishment both LeeAnne and I had to produce our passports, our Indian tourist visa numbers, the dates of issue and expiration for both and our home address and telephone number. I was half worried I&amp;#8217;d need to call home and get my Mom to give me the date of my first day in kindergarten! All this to stay in a room for two nights. India, I implore you&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the rub. I would expect an eye for detail if we were traveling in say Germany or Austria, but this is India! It&amp;#8217;s kind of crazy here. On the way to an internet cafe in Mumbai &amp;#8211; where I had to give the guy at the front desk my Passport, Visa number and home address in the US just to use the internet &amp;#8211; we saw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A dog fight in the middle of a busy street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Cows holding up rush hour traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A woman in her Sari holding a new-born baby in one hand and a baboon on a leash in the other. That was crazy, but here&amp;#8217;s the thing &amp;#8211; she wasn&amp;#8217;t trying to get anyones attention, she was just chillin. That&amp;#8217;s her life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#8217;s all this insanity going on outside, but this guy needs my passport number to get online? Please explain!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Go, Go Goa</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/go-go-goa.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/go-go-goa</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following our escape from Mumbai, we decided to head south, where according to various parties it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;less crazy.&amp;#8221; We chose to come directly to Palolem Beach in southern Goa for a little chill time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goa is a small state on the west coast of India. Until only a few decades ago (60s maybe) it was a Portuguese colony. As a result, there are many old churches and probably the only sizable population of Catholics in the country. Goa is best known however for its beaches. Beaches filled with hippies and all night ravers. Just what Dave and I long for, right? Not exactly. But we owed it to the inspiration of this whole trip to pay a visit. (&lt;a title=&quot;we blame matt damon&quot; href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?page_id=3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remember we blame Matt Damon&lt;/a&gt;.) Fortunately, we&amp;#8217;ve sought out a more &amp;#8220;isolated&amp;#8221; Goan beach during the shoulder season. As a result, we&amp;#8217;ve encountered fewer hippies, better deals and more peace and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everything that Mumbai was for us, Goa seems to be the opposite. Example: In Mumbai, after three days of walking around the city, we never saw one roll of toilet paper &amp;#8211; much to our dismay. The first shop we popped into in Palolem had a pyramid of toilet paper along with every single thing we could have wanted &amp;#8211; some we didn&amp;#8217;t even realize we wanted. A clear sign of a Western presence. The little shop overflowed with toilet paper, soap, half bottles of shampoo, sunscreen, and Dove face wipes (oh how I wanted one of those on the dirty, sticky train ride south!) among other things.&lt;br&gt;
The other obvious signs of tourist villa were the inflated prices of food and lodging and the vast array of food available. All restaurants have a variation of the same offering: Chinese, Mexican, Thai, Pizza, Continental (we&amp;#8217;ve come to recognize this as Italian), Seafood and of course Indian. Most are fairly good. Unfortunately, they are also overpriced for India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we arrived rather late on this first evening, we took what we could get. An overpriced, overly nice room (a whopping $9) on the main street. The up sides of this were (1) Dave was able to watch live EPL soccer games from the comfort of our bed, and (2) it allowed us to walk the beach in search of a good beach hut deal for the remainder of the week. We eventually bargained for a little shack on a quiet cove just off of the main beach. It&amp;#8217;s not the Ritz, but it&amp;#8217;s a good place to read, relax and stare off into the horizon for a week. A recovering desk jockey&amp;#8217;s dream!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Escape from Mumbai</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/escape-from-mumbai.html"/>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When is a 12 hour train-ride in tropical heat with no air conditioning worth it? When it gets you out of Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our journey began before dawn at Mumbai&amp;#8217;s Central Station and would not end until just after night fell on us and our Auto-Ricksaw driver on a beach in Goa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between everything was a whirl of sweat, heat, pollution and &amp;#8220;Che San-wiss&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt about it India is hot. We were really kicking ourseleves for not buying seats on the air-conditioned car (They cost 4 times as much, but may be worth it next time). And there is a crazy amount of pollution. I expected it to fade an hour or three out of Mumbai, but no luck. It followed us the better part of the day. So by the time we did reach our final destination we were covered in a thin film of &amp;#8230;industrial pollution &amp;#8230;burnt household trash, your guess is a good as mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one relief we received was the people. Our co-sufferers were great, pointing us in the right direction on all matters from buses to which station we needed to get off at. And then there are the services of the &amp;#8220;Wait Staff&amp;#8221; in third class coach &amp;#8211; quite nice. No need to get up &amp;#8211; they come buy hawking all manner of food and drink, Chai Tea for 5 Rupees, Che San-wiss (Cheese Sandwiches), Omlets and a very nice veg Tali for 35 rupees, not too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we ran out of rail, we had to make our way to the beach via &amp;#8220;Tuk-Tuk&amp;#8221; a three wheeled Auto-Ricksaw. In hindsight, we should have taken a full size taxi. Our poor Tuk-Tuk was constantly being passed on the hour and a half trip that probably would have taken 35 minutes in a regular car. No worries though, he earned his 400 rupees the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the good people of the Indian Railway system for making our departure from Mumbai possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hooray for Bolliwood</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/hooray-for-bolliwood.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/hooray-for-bolliwood</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jokingly one of our goals on this trip was to get cast in a Bolliwood movie: Mission Accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was surprisingly easy. There are some 700 movies made in Mumbai a year so the numbers are working for you if you want to be cast as an extra. We had heard that simply by being white and hanging out in the Colaba district (the main tourist area) in Mumbai long enough you could get offers to be in movies. Sure enough, we hadn&amp;#8217;t been walking down the Colaba Causeway five minutes the day after our arrival before we were &amp;#8220;discovered&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our studio contact had few details: if we agreed he&amp;#8217;d pick us and about 20 others us that night at 7PM. We&amp;#8217;d be bussed out to the airport where they were shooting that night. The shoot would run from 7PM to 5AM. We&amp;#8217;d be provided with food, bottled water and at the end of the shoot each extra would be paid 500 Rupees (about 10 USD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling us &amp;#8220;Extras&amp;#8221; is very unsavory. We prefer the term &amp;#8220;Background Actors&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course this isn&amp;#8217;t the kind of thing you do for money, so after confirming that this was a real Bolliwood movie and not a commercial or anything, we signed up.&lt;br&gt;
So where do you pick up 20 white people in downtown Mumbai at 7PM? In front of McDonalds of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once there we waited around for a few hours, then were lined up men on one side ladies on the other, and cast in our roles. I came very close to losing my role as a pilot, finding a uniform to fit me was an issue. But LeeAnne was already perfectly dressed as an airline passenger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LeeAnne and I learned a very important lesson that night: the allure of Bolliwood is built on a foundation of boring, boring repetition. &amp;#8220;BACK TO ONE!&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; our call back to our positions to do another take, exactly the same way we did before, or maybe a little different, but only if the director specifically TOLD us to do it different became by the end of the night three words we never want to hear again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole evening reminded me of an episode of &amp;#8220;Extras&amp;#8221;. When you&amp;#8217;re a background actor there&amp;#8217;s a lot of sitting around waiting in stupid outfits shooting the shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each scene took about two hours to film, and luckily for me, none of them involved dancing or singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were only on the set for one night, but from what we could gather the movie seems to be some kind of action/comedy/love story involving a plane and maybe a bomb. In any event it&amp;#8217;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473367/&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; and it stars Imran Khan, Aamir Khans nephew (You will have to know something about Bolliwood for that last bit to mean anything).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mumbai Madness</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/india/mumbai-madness.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/india/mumbai-madness</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant 9 hour flight from Darwin, we arrived in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay) on Wednesday evening.  Our arrival was as smooth as could be expected at any international city.  Breeze through immigration, pick up our bags, change some money and walk right through customs.  Get a pre-paid taxi to the city and we&amp;#8217;re on our way.  That&amp;#8217;s probably where easy ends in India. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride from the airport to the city isn&amp;#8217;t that far but can take up to 2 hours in rush hour traffic.  At 7:45pm on a Wednesday night it took us about an hour and a half.   A taxi ride in Mumbai is something like threading a needle &amp;#8211; a moving, frenetic, horn honking needle.  We spent most of the ride wide-eyed and in awe of the world we were seeing.  There should have been a least a dozen accidents, but we saw none.  There were taxis, auto rickshaws, motor bikes, buses and trucks all weaving in and out somehow turning the three marked lanes into five.  Everyone honks, no one slows down and yet, it all seems to flow like some kind of dance.  In and out, fast and then slow, finding a narrow space between two vehicles and land or no lane, threading the needle right through them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we suspected, the hotel we thought we had reserved &amp;#8211;  which are kind taxi driver did not have an easy time finding &amp;#8211;  had no room for us.  So at 9:00pm we were in the middle of a huge city with no place to stay.  The guy mentioned trying a place down the block.  They had rooms.  As seems to be common practice here, they tried pushing the deluxe suite with private bathroom on us, but for half the price we insisted on the little room with twin beds and shared bath.  After paying our rupees, they let us know that the AC didn&amp;#8217;t work in that room.  We retired to our dark, little cell of a room with no windows and no AC.  Though I did see a tourist from time to time, it was by and large a hotel inhabited by Indians.  It was overpriced, but most hotels in Mumbai are, and not overly comfortable, but we made do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we wandered out into the city, passing the Victoria Terminus train station &amp;#8211; an architectural highlight, the cricket oval and many beautiful buildings &amp;#8211; all remnants of colonial days.  We made our way to Colaba &amp;#8211; the touristy area of town &amp;#8211; and to the Gateway to India &amp;#8211; where people offered to sell us just about everything except their children.  (Really, what could we possible want with a 4 foot orange balloon in the shape of a gourd?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had heard that hiring a guide was a good idea to see some of the more outlying sites. We ambled over to the tourist stand where someone quickly began haggling.  We bargained some.  Not enough.  Frankly we were still tired and overwhelmed.  We set off with Dimesh in a a very nice car, but with the windows down.  AC was extra and we had some budget traveler standards to maintain.  Though we both agreed that we paid too much for the tour, we were also both happy to sit back, see the sights and ask questions of our friendly guide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the highlights were visiting a fishermen&amp;#8217;s village, observing men washing clothes at the centuries old dobi, walking into a Jain temple and reading letters from Ghandi to Tolstoy and Hitler at Mani Bhavan &amp;#8211; where he spent his time in Bombay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that pleasant respite, and after respectfully decline a private drive to Goa for 18,000 rupees (train tickets are 600)we wandered back to Colaba Market area, where our fate quickly changed.  Refer to &lt;a title=&quot;Hooray for Bolliwood&quot; href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=79&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hooray for Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mumbai is everything I expected but couldn&amp;#8217;t possibly prepare for.  Having read Maximum City (I recommend it &amp;#8211; unless you are one of our parents.), I knew we wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to stay too long here.  It&amp;#8217;s hot, overcrowded, filthy, loud &amp;#8211; everything you expect of a third world city &amp;#8211; but here the scale of it is immense.  Some estimate that nearly 20 million people live here.  Consider that under 9 million people live in the five boroughs of New York City &amp;#8211; the largest city in the U.S.  And these people are everywhere.  If you&amp;#8217;re on the streets in the early morning hours, you&amp;#8217;ll find thousands of people &amp;#8211; entire families &amp;#8211; sleeping on the streets.  In some places, they have made makeshift homes, while in others in the central city will simply lie down on the sidewalk &amp;#8211; babies at their side, women in saris &amp;#8211; and sleep through the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently reading Paul Theroux&amp;#8217;s book, &amp;#8220;The Great Railway Bazaar&amp;#8221; where he takes trains from London all through Asia and back again.  He made this journey over 30 years ago.   I found some perverse comfort in his observations about India.  He too struggled to see these makeshift cities, which most people just step over or around and continue on their way.  This is life here. What&amp;#8217;s scary is not that 30 years ago he shared the same feelings, but that over 100 years ago, Mark Twain wrote the following upon visiting Bombay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seemed to move through a city of the dead.  There was hardly a suggestion of life in those still and vacant streets. Even the crows were silent.  But everywhere on the ground lay sleeping natives &amp;#8211; hundreds and hundreds.  They lay stretched at full length and tightly wrapped in blankets, heads and all.  Their attitude and rigidity counterfeited death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this leaves Dave and I with a lot to contemplate.  We are a long way from the comforts and seclusion of our home in DC. Thankfully, we have found some delicious Indian food to help us along our way.&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#8217;re also sadly saying good-bye to things like clean tap water, salads and the ubiquitous first world flush toilet. C&amp;#8217;est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re saying hello to a country in the midst of World Cup (of Cricket) frenzy. Do you know who the Captain of the India National team is? Neither do we. But I&amp;#8217;m sure we will learn. More to come.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Australia Notes For Budget Travelers</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/australia-notes-for-budget-travelers.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/australia-notes-for-budget-travelers</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that Australia is not the cheapest of countries on our itinerary. That said, the country is well equipped for backpackers on a budget. Like &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;New Zealand Notes for Budget Travelers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=53&quot;&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, if you watch your $ in the cities and self-cater (camp and cook yourself), you can stretch your dollars pretty far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things we learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renting a car, even with the cost of gas, was cheaper than buying train and/or bus tickets for two people to various sites throughout the country. It also meant we had more freedom to see and do what we want. Though we didn&amp;#8217;t have the bargain rental we had in NZ, we did pretty well. Between the rental and gas, which is cheaper than in NZ but still much more than the US, we spent about $800 and drove just under 5000 km. Without a car, it would have been impossible to really enjoy the Great Ocean Road as well as the quirky towns of the New South Wales Outback. That said, Australia is a HUGE place. We had to give up our hopes of making it to the middle (i.e. Uluru and Alice Springs). There was also the small detail about our car not being allowed to venture into that territory. Apparently it is not a good place to break down!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like NZ, hostels in cities (mostly Sydney) were one of our largest expenses. Both times we visited Sydney, we stayed in newer hostels near the Central Train Station. The location was great and the hostels, particularly the Railway YHA, were new and quite nice. The first time we came through Sydney, we stuck it out in an 8 bed dorm room to save some cash. Yes, that&amp;#8217;s 8 people and all their crap in a room about the size of my office at CCHD. The savings wasn&amp;#8217;t worth it. We&amp;#8217;re just too old for that crap! (I&amp;#8217;ll spare you the details of what &amp;#8220;crap&amp;#8221; entailed.) Our hostel in Darwin was the only bargain, but that might have had something to do with the run down bathrooms, the 5:00am carpet cleaning outside our room and the monsoonal rains of the wet season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, campgrounds were less costly than NZ. The down side of some were that the kitchens had limited equipment. Usually a fridge, a sink, a coin operated grill and some type of hot water maker (electric kettle or hot water tap). Since camp kitchens in NZ were so well equipped, we opted not to buy gas for our stove. This hurt a few times when there was no hot plate or stove, but we managed to be creative with couscous and grilled veggies. An up side of the campgrounds in Oz were that they were mostly inhabited by Australians rather than tourists like ourselves. We met some nice and interesting folks along the way. Like Fred &amp;#038; Shirley &amp;#8211; who reminded me of one of those couples being interviewed in When Harry Met Sally &amp;#8211; or the Vietnam Vet biker dude from Townsville who will be traveling to DC for Rolling Thunder in May with his local bike club and their sister club in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike NZ, we never had the sense that we were being gouged because it&amp;#8217;s summer here and there are loads of tourists, though I suspect there are always tourists. One exception was Darwin, but that actually worked in our favor. Our room was just a little over half the price of a double room in Sydney &amp;#8211; though as previously mentioned it was not as nice. I imagine in the Dry (our summer months) this city crawls with tourists and steeper prices. In general, we didn&amp;#8217;t feel like everything was a tourist trap with a price tag down under. The Great Ocean Road and our tour of the wineries &amp;#8211; two highlights &amp;#8211; cost us only gas money!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re looking for the extended holiday but are low on cash, Oz is another good place to look for work. Bulletin boards at hostels are full of postings and most major backpacker centers offer some sort of job placement service. One of our dorm mates in Sydney was working as a server at a restaurant on Darling Harbor making $15/hr plus tips. It seemed to adequately subsidize his drinking habit. Dave and I were briefly entertained by the demand for office/computer work in Alice Springs. How random! Every other place seemed to be agricultural work, but poor little Alice Springs way out in the middle of the country just need someone to sit in an office and do admin work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously getting robbed cost us, but we won&amp;#8217;t hold that against Oz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Top End &#8211; Darwin</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/the-top-end-darwin.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/the-top-end-darwin</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in our last stop in Australia before we head off to India. Darwin is the capitol of the Northern Territory, but it&amp;#8217;s only a city of about 50,000 people and it has a very different feel from most of the other Australian cities that we&amp;#8217;ve visited. First of all it tropical &amp;#8211; by that I mean it&amp;#8217;s both HOT and HUMID &amp;#8211; the day we flew in it was 91 degrees, but with the humidity factored in it felt like 106. Sadly, this is a normal day in Darwin. Secondly, there are actually Aboriginal people in town. For whatever reason, they don&amp;#8217;t avoid Darwin like they do the other capitol cities we&amp;#8217;ve been too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, given Darwin&amp;#8217;s location on the ocean and it&amp;#8217;s extreme temperatures, we would be headed for the beach &amp;#8211; wrong. No one is here at the Top End. One reason: Salt Water Crocodiles that can swim in the ocean, crap! Want another reason? Box Jellyfish &amp;#8211; they can kill humans with a single sting. Double crap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is there to do in Darwin? Well honestly, we weren&amp;#8217;t expecting too much, but we&amp;#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised. We&amp;#8217;re here in &amp;#8220;The Wet&amp;#8221; (Their wet season runs most of the summer down here) and many things are closed for the season. But as I said before there&amp;#8217;s an Aboriginal presence here and there are several art galleries in town that feature Aboriginal artists. There&amp;#8217;s a free (and air conditioned) museum with a terrific exhibits on how people and nature have tried to destroy the city. It was bombarded by the Japanese in World War II, and it was almost completely wiped off the map after Cyclone Tracy hit it on Christmas Eve 1974 (The parallels with Hurricane Katrina are eerie). And there&amp;#8217;s a casino with a million dollar pool &amp;#8211; they spent a million dollars on the pool, it&amp;#8217;s a VERY nice pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s just stuff to do IN town. There are a number of national parks near the city that offer up close and person views of Salt Water Crocs and other wildlife. And of course Darwin is a main jumping off point for Uluru (Ayers Rock). Not too shabby, now if the city could just avoid being destroyed again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aussies are very close cousins to Americans in many ways, in fact had it not been for the American Revolution many of them (the convict labor) would have ended up in Georgia, not half-way around the world. Here are two culinary examples of why that separation should be praised or panned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Pro &amp;#8211; It saved us from &amp;#8220;The Lot&amp;#8221;. Say what you will about America, but without it where would the Hamburger and Pizza be? America popularized both, Australia has ruined them. First strike &amp;#8211; rather than tomato Aussies put slices of beets on their burgers. Yes, beets disgusting beets. As if that wasn&amp;#8217;t bad enough, they go further and have &amp;#8220;The Lot&amp;#8221;. You can order a burger with the Lot, or a Pizza with the Lot. What&amp;#8217;s the Lot? Start with everything we in the states put on them &amp;#8211; then add beets, bacon, and a whole fried egg. Ever tried a burger with an egg on it? How about a Pizza? Still hungry?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Con &amp;#8211; It keeps Tim-Tams on the other side of the world. After your typical Aussie downs a burger or pizza with the lot on it. They may care for a tasty treat. Tim-Tams are the number one snack food in Aus, hands down, and rightfully so. They&amp;#8217;re kind of like gourmet Twix, but smaller and better all around. It&amp;#8217;s hard to describe just how delicious these things are. They serve as a parallel currency in some corners of the country. And some say you can track the standard of living across the country by their availability and price. Please someone, hear me. Bring Tim-Tams to the States!&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>It&#8217;s Raining Books</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/its-raining-books.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/its-raining-books</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, reading is a popular past time for Dave and I these days. It&amp;#8217;s also something we were both looking forward to on the trip. Prior to our departure, as we packed up the house we made little piles of books we&amp;#8217;d take and not so little piles of books we&amp;#8217;d have our friend Mary send to us down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we&amp;#8217;ve added to our collection from good finds in used bookstores in Christchurch and more recently in Australia. We&amp;#8217;ve found that each store is a little different and most are overflowing with more character than books!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little, hippie mountain town of Katoomba in the Blue Mountains has a disproportionately high number of used bookstores for its size. We cruised a few and traded in 6 of our previous reads for 4 more. The shop owner seemed please enough with the Booker Prize winners. The others he referred to as &amp;#8220;potluck&amp;#8221;. There was no convincing him about Sarah Vowell.&lt;br&gt;
The best used bookstore we&amp;#8217;ve come across by far was in Newtown in Sydney. Much like the neighborhood, Gould&amp;#8217;s Book Arcade is overflowing with personality! Our introduction to the bookstore was actually a news story we caught while traveling elsewhere in Australia. A bus driver became a local hero when he leaped from the bus he was driving to chase a thief from Gould&amp;#8217;s down the street and performed a citizen&amp;#8217;s arrest. He returned to a standing ovation from his passengers and is quickly being immortalized around town. The best part of the story was that (for a reason that I unfortunately can not recall) the bookstore owners actually gave him the books he tried to steal! I want to say they were self-help books, but just can&amp;#8217;t recall.&lt;br&gt;
Apparently Mr. Gould is a real mainstay of the Australian left. You could guess as much with the dozens of books and &amp;#8216;zines on how to grow cannabis along side a small collection of porn magazines near the front register. Rest assured there is a time limit for perusing the porn on site. These are quirky, amusing parts of a visit to the book arcade, but not actually what first grabs your eye. The first thing you really notice are the aisles and aisles of seriously big stacks of books. Aside from the knee high stacks of books blocking the lowest shelf, I have to admit that the fiction aisles were pretty well organized. Within a few minutes we had rounded out our Paul Theroux collection with an additional 3 books. The real laugh was upstairs. If you really want that book on economics, you are going to have to work for it! Who knows how many books were in Bob Gould&amp;#8217;s Book Arcade, but you could easily spend a day roaming, or should I say climbing, the stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, Dave and I have had fun building our book collection. When we leave Darwin for Mumbai, we should have it down to a mere 14 books. Yes, we are crazy, but we also have a few long plane and train rides ahead of us!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Newtown &#8211; One Hell of a Town</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/newtown-one-hell-of-a-town.html"/>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/newtown-one-hell-of-a-town</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re back in Sydney for one night to return our rental car and jump on a plane to Darwin. Luckily this gives us a chance to visit one of our favorite neighborhoods in Sydney: Newtown. Unlike the tourist ghetto where all of the hostels are, or the CBD where all the hotels are Newtown feels like a place where real live actual Sydneysiders live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s kind of a cross between Adams Morgan and 17th St in Washington. There are a lot of restaurants and bars of all ilk and quite a few locally owned bookstores. For a taste of what life is like for real people in Sydney this is a good place to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two highlights for us were Gomez &amp;#038; Guzman &amp;#8211; a real life Mexican restaurant staffed by real Mexicans &amp;#8211; how they got here I have no idea. But it&amp;#8217;s authentic and delicious. The other is Goulds Bookstore, a mostly used books store that is a librarians worst nightmare. The ground floor bears some semblance of order, but the upstairs looks like a bomb hit it &amp;#8230;literally shelves so overflowing that the books have fallen off and cover the floor in places. Great prices &amp;#8211; but you have to kind of be willing to put some effort into separating the wheat from the chafe.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The True Blue Mountains</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/the-true-blue-mountains.html"/>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We spent the final days of our Oz road trip in the Blue Mountains just an hour and a half outside of Sydney. It was quite amazing to watch the dry, dusty land gradually turn into rolling green as we made our approach. I have to admit. I am a green person. As much as I enjoyed and appreciated the Outback, I felt comforted looking out over the green valleys of the Blue Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are wondering, these mountains aren&amp;#8217;t really like the blue mountains of southwestern Virginia. They are a bit more dramatic with their many rock formations and cliffs. They are called the blue mountains, so I am told, because the eucalyptus oil from the trees in the air causes a blue haze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big attractions in the Blue Mountains is the Three Sisters &amp;#8211; three very large rock formations visible from the Echo Point Lookout. Rather than me plagiarizing, you should read the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Three Sisters Aboriginal Dream Time Legend&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bluemts.com.au/tourist/thingsToDo/threeSisters.asp&quot;&gt;aboriginal dream-time legend&lt;/a&gt; of the Three Sisters. We took an extra day to hike for a few hours around the Three Sisters, along the cliff walk and through the Jamison Valley. It was great, but our legs were surprisingly tired after descending the 870 very steep Giant Steps and then later ascending the not as many, but still steep Furber Steps. This is what too many days sitting in a car will get you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for you Darkness fans, you can catch some of the Blue Mountains scenery in their &lt;a title=&quot;The Darkness in the Blue Mountains&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50EALZU4D6A&quot;&gt;video for Love Is Only A Feeling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As our car camping adventure in Aus continues we headed back to Sydney via the Outback. To say there&amp;#8217;s a lot of nothing out there is a bit of an understatement. Aside from mining towns, road houses, road trains and red dust there&amp;#8217;s not too much. We went through about three or four real towns in the better part of a week. There were three types: surprisingly big-ish towns centered around the mining industry, ghost towns and very poor run-down aboriginal towns with &amp;#8230;no industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this nothing you would figure there wouldn&amp;#8217;t be too much to say about these towns. You&amp;#8217;d be wrong, movie makers love this place, and they keep coming. It seems like every town we stopped at had been the set of some movie or another. Breaker Morant was filmed in Burra, Broken Hill played host to Priscilla Queen of the Desert, and the near ghost town of Silverton was the set of Mad Max. Cobar was home to &amp;#8230;okay, there&amp;#8217;s nothing in Cobar (except free internet!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And flat, let&amp;#8217;s talk about flat. On a ridge north of Silverton you can literally see the curvature of the Earth. It&amp;#8217;s a crazy strange and strangely beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Outback Radio, Oh-oh!</title>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/outback-radio-oh-oh</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the downsides of the outback is the dearth of radio stations available. We had grown use to pretty good radio here &amp;#8211; much better than the states &amp;#8211; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/&quot;&gt;Triple J&lt;/a&gt; is a standout. You loose all those once you leave the cities. For the most part there&amp;#8217;s nothing on FM, and AM radio is home to crazy talk shows and live Cricket matches &amp;#8230;we listened to more than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, there are a few music based stations on AM in the outback. They play the worst music possible. I really think they can only afford music donated to them by larger stations once they have played them out. The selection is terrible &amp;#8211; or genius &amp;#8211; you be the judge. Here&amp;#8217;s a block of tracks we heard as we approached Broken Hill:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Summer Loving &amp;#8211; Grease Original Soundtrack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I Don&amp;#8217;t Like Reggae (I Love It) &amp;#8211; Bob Marley and The Wailers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  USA For Africa &amp;#8211; We Are the World&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Give it Up &amp;#8211; KC and the Sunshine Band&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tone Loc &amp;#8211; Funky Cold Medina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Funky Cold Medina&amp;#8221; following up &amp;#8220;We Are the World&amp;#8221;!?!?! How insane is this place?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Fabulous Cook Family</title>

        <updated>2007-03-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/the-fabulous-cook-family</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of you know our friend Lorraine (aka cycling fool). Well if you do, then you are aware that she is one great lady.  It should come as no surprise then that her family in Adelaide are equally awesome.  We felt they were deserving of their very own entry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before leaving for our big trip, Lorraine offered a place for us to stay with her family in Adelaide.  It turned to be even more than our own little bungalow where we could relax at the end of the day.  Her brother Dean helped to coordinate our visit, picked up mail for us, gave us a tour of the city on his day off and even pointed us towards a camera store when our stuff was stolen.  We had just a brief visit with Mum, but she was a delight. Telling great stories of her whirlwind adventures all over the U.S. and Europe with Lorraine. Quite the AFL fan too!  We&amp;#8217;re sorry that we didn&amp;#8217;t get to spend time with the rest of the family, but alas, we had to make the trek back to Sydney with the car sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite our bad luck at the beach in Adelaide, the Cook family made our stay there very comfortable and very memorable.  As with all our hosts, we hope to return the favor some day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dude, Where&#8217;s Our Stuff?</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/dude-wheres-our-stuff.html"/>
        <updated>2007-03-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/dude-wheres-our-stuff</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely day, the sun was shining, birds were singing, the air was hot, the water was cold. Then we went back to the car&amp;#8230; did you notice there&amp;#8217;s no photo attached to this entry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second to last day in Adelaide our car was broken into and a bunch of stuff was stolen. LeeAnne&amp;#8217;s purse and everything that goes with it and our cameras &amp;#8211; both of them. It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were spending the day on the beach south of Adelaide &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a bigger beach, well developed with a boardwalk &amp;#8211; kind of like Va. Beach or Ocean City. Anyway, we did everything we could to help out whoever the thief was. Our stay in Adelaide had been so pleasant we let our guard down. We were driving a car with out of state plates, we parked in public parking at the beach (The Beach! The number 1 place to get ripped off!) right up at the boardwalk, next to the public bathrooms, we left our copy of &amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s Go: Australia&amp;#8221; visible in the front seat and a duffel bag of camping gear visible in the back seat. The only thing we neglected to do was put a sign in the front window that read: &amp;#8220;Hello! We are Tourists!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For safekeeping of course we put the cameras (which we had no business taking in the first place) and LeeAnnes purse in the trunk. They came in through the drivers side read door and made a bee-line for the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we were being watched, maybe not, but they got us good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we changed our minds about Adelaide, still a wonderful city. But we did learn a painful lesson &amp;#8211; if you don&amp;#8217;t need it while you&amp;#8217;re out don&amp;#8217;t take it. Leave it somewhere relatively safe (not the trunk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our last day in Adelaide was spent camera shopping. They are a little behind the curve here: LeeAnne&amp;#8217;s camera hasn&amp;#8217;t even been released in Aus yet. So she got a comparable Cannon point and shoot. I&amp;#8217;m going to wait until we hit Hong Kong to see about replacing the digital SLR &amp;#8211; maybe there will be a deal waiting for us there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vibrant Straw with Flecks of Brilliant Green</title>

        <updated>2007-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/vibrant-straw-with-flecks-of-brilliant-green</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you hear something like &amp;#8220;vibrant straw with flecks of brilliant green&amp;#8221;, what do you think?  I am guessing it wasn&amp;#8217;t, &lt;em&gt;mmmm&amp;#8230; pour me one of those&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably well know, Australia is home to many a wine that we enjoy in the U.S.  In fact, I&amp;#8217;ve come to learn that Australia is home to some 60 wine regions.  We, or more appropriately I, had the good fortune to venture into the Clare and Barossa Valley Wine Regions while visiting Adelaide.  Dave was the supportive designated driver on this excursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it amazing that anything can grow on this dry land, much less millions of little grapes that produce &amp;#8220;soft and fleshy structure, with surprisingly persistent length of flavour to a clean finish.&amp;#8221;  (Yes, for me, one of the highlights of wine tasting is the tasting notes.  Chock full of elaborate descriptions that I could not possibly ever concoct. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first ventured into the smaller, farther off Clare Valley. This area is made up of about 30 vineyards and is known for its Reislings.  The real reason for our trip to Clare was to visit Tim Adams Winery (yes, my brother&amp;#8217;s name is Tim).  It&amp;#8217;s a small winery with none other than the 2006 World Champion Reisling.  Who knew?  Not me.  I&amp;#8217;m not really much of a white wine drinker and much less a fan of sticky sweet Reislings.  As it turns out, Tim Adams got this one right.  (Probably an overachiever just like the bro&amp;#8217;.)  In fact, it was delicious and by far the tastiest of the wines I tried that day.  The best part &amp;#8211; it whipped all those German Reislings&amp;#8217; butts!  It must really goad all those Europeans with their overpriced wines when Oz came onto the scene with pretty good wine at far better prices!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After visiting Clare Valley we swung through the Barrossa Valley &amp;#8211; a far larger and more well known wine region.  Since there is a limit to Dave&amp;#8217;s patience while I swill wine, we only stopped at one other winery &amp;#8211; the infamous Jacob&amp;#8217;s Creek winery.  This was like the Disneyland of wineries.  You could check out a high-tech interactive display, see the kangaroos in the bush, take your picture in front of the Jacob&amp;#8217;s Creek sign, eat an overpriced meal and of course drink wine.  This is where the tour buses go.  Despite all that, I had the chance to taste some wines we don&amp;#8217;t see in the US and that are frankly of much higher quality then what we can get in stores. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the penny-pinching backpacker perspective, the best aspect of Australian wineries is that the tastings are free.  Just next door in New Zealand, wineries were more of a tourist attraction where you had to pay a hefty fee just get through the cellar door.  This is yet another reason to love Australia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry to say that the pictures of wine country went the way of the two cameras.  Hope someone is enjoying them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Little Adelaide</title>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/little-adelaide</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems Adelaide has something of a self-image problem. It&amp;#8217;s not hard to understand why &amp;#8211; with competition like Sydney &amp;#038; Melbourne it&amp;#8217;s easy to think of oneself as a little provincial. I can assure you this is not the case. Adelaide is a great jumping off point to many points of interest in South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the east you&amp;#8217;ve got the Great Ocean Road, to the west you&amp;#8217;ve got Kangaroo Island &amp;#8211; one of the best places in the country to see wildlife in the wild. If you go north you&amp;#8217;ve got some of the most prolific wine regions in the world, and if you go south there are ten beaches to choose from. Not too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city itself reminds me of somewhere in the Southwest US. It&amp;#8217;s dry and sunny here most of the year and the local architecture reflects that. Lots of low, wide homes built with masonry and nice decks rather than over the top lawns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in town, despite what they may say in Melbourne or Sydney, there&amp;#8217;s a lot going on. We&amp;#8217;re here during the Adelaide Film Festival, there&amp;#8217;s a Grand Prix in town, and we&amp;#8217;re leaving just before the start of a World Music Festival and Fringe Festival. Oh, and AFL (Aussie Rules Football) is just getting ready to start up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and whatever else they may say &amp;#8230;Adelaide is the capitol of South Australia and the only colony in Oz not founded by convicts. Suck on that New South Wales &amp;#038; Victoria!&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the more mundane things we do &amp;#8211; a lot, of thank you Mr. Blog &amp;#8211; is find Internet access. For those of you who haven&amp;#8217;t traveled abroad recently there are a lot of ways to get online. Some are surprising, others surprisingly stupid. And for those sitting in the comfort of your home or office relaxing and taking as much time and bandwidth as you please &amp;#8211; we envy you. We tourists are getting clipped a couple of dollars for every hour we&amp;#8217;re online. Remember, accessing the Internet is a privilege &amp;#8211; not a right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we have seen or used Internet terminal in &amp;#8211; convenience stores, airports, information centers, libraries, hostels, campgrounds, gas stations (yes, gas stations) and of course the infamous Internet cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst possible way to get online &amp;#8211; the coin operated &amp;#8220;Internet Machine&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; you will find these in your lower quality hostel, your higher quality campgrounds and every airport. Woe upon you if you have to resort to using these devil machines. They are almost always slow, outdated, expensive and probably owned by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get online &amp;#8211; find the Chinatown in the city you&amp;#8217;re visiting. I know it&amp;#8217;s wrong to generalize, but Asians do love to get online &amp;#8211; and usually in Chinatown it&amp;#8217;s going to be cheaper, faster and the computers may have had a security update in the past 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to do some online banking &amp;#8211; don&amp;#8217;t. But if you must, generally the library has the most locked down moderated computer lab. But the days of free Internet access for tourists at your friendly local library are gone my friend. Get ready to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Internet cafe proprietor in the world includes World of Warcraft in his or her prayers every night that game alone keeps them in business &amp;#8211; well, that and Japanese tourists. I have seen many sad things on this trip already, but none so sad as the overweight 40 year old man who kept hogging one of the two coin operated Internet machines (that cost over 8 dollars an hour!) playing WOW for over four and 1/2 hours in a hostel in Auckland. The most damming thing &amp;#8211; he was there with his family, teaching his toddler the way of the Orchs and avoiding his wife.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes From the Great Ocean Road</title>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/notes-from-the-great-ocean-road</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re on the Great Ocean Road at the moment. It runs from the suburbs of Melbourne to the edge of South Australia and was built after WWI as kind of a works project to employ returning veterans in the 1920&amp;#8217;s, before that the only way to access the small towns along the road was by ship or ferry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone was thinking when they laid it out. Besides linking quaint &amp;#8211; touristy &amp;#8211; little towns to the rest of the world it also gives people access to some insane limestone cliffs and unique pillars haystacks etc just offshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took our time and made a few days of the ride stopping over in Apollo Bay and Port Fairy (That&amp;#8217;s the name of the place &amp;#8211; got a problem with it that? It was probably founded by some very manly, um, sailors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have actually been along the Great Ocean Road when I was here before back in 1999, but it was still impressive &amp;#8211; and that time I was going the opposite direction west to east so many of the views this time were new. The Great Ocean Road has to be one of our high points in Australia for sure. If you&amp;#8217;re planning a trip make time for it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marvelous Melbourne</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/melbourne.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/melbourne</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a few days on the road from Sydney we arrived in Melbourne &amp;#8211; the second largest city in Australia and the capital of the state of Victoria.  Aside from a stroll though the Botanical Gardens and along the Yarra River, we spent most of our brief visit to the city at the Queen Victoria Market and at the Melbourne Zoo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Dave had visited Melbourne in the past, he had an idea of a few highlights of the city that we might enjoy.  The 125+ year old Market is definitely one of them.  Lucky for us we arrived on a Wednesday just in time to stumble upon the weekly summer Night Market where a smaller number of venders fill one of the buildings with an array of delicious food and live music.  It was fun to feel like we were &amp;#8220;out on the town&amp;#8221; for a change.  We enjoyed a delicious hippy-made burrito and some raucous steel drum samba music topped off, of course, with bretzel (not really sure why the b) dipped in Belgian chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we returned to the market so I could see the real deal in all its glory.  You can buy just about anything there from $10 soccer jerseys (Dave&amp;#8217;s holding out &amp;#8217;til China) to gourmet cheese to fresh meats and produce.  We lamented not being hungry after eating the free breakfast at the hotel and settled only for some dark chocolate covered almonds and coffee beans.  Still yummy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the big market tour, we ventured further out of town to the zoo.  A few of the newer areas are quite spectacular.  Rather than grouping animals together (i.e. big cats &amp;#8211; which incidentally sleep all day) like at a traditional zoo, they have created habitats such as the Asian and African rainforests where you walk down a path and observe animals in a more natural environment.  The Asian rainforest was particularly clever with little roadside shacks set up as if you were on a little road in Thailand.  Quite enjoyable, though there were no animals eating out of our hands today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up our all too short stay in Melbourne with what we&amp;#8217;ll call the &amp;#8220;Jeanne Connection &amp;#8211; Part 1.&amp;#8221; We had a wonderful dinner with Eric, Jeanne&amp;#8217;s friend from graduate school, and his partner Elsie.  We traded travel tales, Peace Corps stories (Eric&amp;#8217;s are definitely some of the best EVER!!) and heard the inside scoop on life in Oz.  We really do appreciate and enjoy these opportunities to connect with people as we venture around the world!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Phillip Island Wildlife Park</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/phillip-island-wildlife-park.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/phillip-island-wildlife-park</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Making our way west from Sydney toward Melbourne, we decided to head a little off route to visit Phillip Island just southeast of Melbourne. Our trusty guidebook highlighted a couple of interesting wildlife opportunities &amp;#8211; one in particular where you could interact with and feed kangaroos, wallabies and emus. The brochures highlight the Penguin Parade, the Koala Conservation Centre and opportunities to see Australian Fur Seals just off the coast. Since we&amp;#8217;d seen a similar parade of penguins in Oamuru and fur seals in NZ, we were interested in seeing koalas and &amp;#8216;roos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited the Phillip Island Wildlife Park &amp;#8211; despite the information centre staff providing us with misinformation and trying to steer us toward the Koala Centre. (We later learned that there is some serious kick back action happening with the other places.) It turned out to be a definite highlight of our Aussie experience so far! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were greeted by clever and very cute little wallabies that know you receive a free bag of food with your admission.  We saw koalas munching on eucalyptus leaves, dingoes salivating at any animal that walked past, and a pacing Tasmanian Devil (who later settled down for a nice nap).  Sorry kids they don&amp;#8217;t look like the cartoon character, but they are certainly cute &amp;#8211; in funny looking way.  We saw lots of interesting and crazy birds of prey and were followed around by a cult of emus who just knew we had some food in our pockets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most amazing part was walking down into the scrub where the kangaroos roam.  It was approaching mid-day and pretty hot, so there was not a lot of activity.  We spotted one checking us out.  It seemed much more cautious than the wallabies that hop over to you without hesitation.  The kangaroo in question scratched itself, made a couple of small, very slow steps in our direction, then Hop! Hop! Hop!  There it was right in front of us.  Pretty crazy!  It ate gently from our hands as we stared in awe.  After a while others perked up and came over to investigate.  It was at times a little intimidating as they move pretty quickly and naturally will be territorial about food, but it was also quite awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Diary of a Car Camper &#8211; Australia</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/diary-of-a-car-camper-australia.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/diary-of-a-car-camper-australia</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re leaving Sydney and car camping again. If you&amp;#8217;ll recall we were &lt;a href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=42&quot;&gt;hooked up in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; with a very chear rental. In Australia, not so lucky. Still lucky, we have it for $29.00 a day AUD, and it&amp;#8217;s a much sweeter ride. It&amp;#8217;s a Corolla just like we had in New Zealand, but a 2006 model rather than a 1996 model like we had over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got it from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Buget.com.au&quot;&gt;Buget.com.au&lt;/a&gt; their price was better than anything else saw &amp;#8211; it even beat &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kayak.com&quot;&gt;kayak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll have it for about three weeks. Unlimited milage, but we can&amp;#8217;t take it into the Northern Territory or Western Australia. The only thing that is taking some getting use to is that this rental &amp;#8211; unlike what we had in New Zealand &amp;#8211; is a stick shift, on the wrong side! So it&amp;#8217;s taken a bit to get use to shifting with the left hand &amp;#8211; oh, and the flashers and windshield wipers are on the opposite side to, so for the first few days we were flipping on the wipers ever time we wanted to make a turn. LeeAnne has a little better handle on things so she gets to do the city driving. No worries mate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Year (Chinese New Year) in Sydney</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/australia/new-year-chinese-new-year-in-sydney.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/australia/new-year-chinese-new-year-in-sydney</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#8217;re here in Sydney and we&amp;#8217;re learning that Sydney kind of marches to the beat of a different drummer. Part of the reason we came to Sydney when we did was timing. Chinese New Year is on the February 18th this year, and Mardi Gras is on the following Tuesday &amp;#8211; two very different and very fun holidays that Sydneysiders loves to celebrate. So our timing is perfect right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, almost. Seems in Sydney Chinese New Year is kind of celebrated all month and the event that we really came here for &amp;#8211; the Dragon boat races &amp;#8211; won&amp;#8217;t be on until early March. And Mardi Gras is celebrated (get this) on March 4th! Not even a Tuesday people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, LeeAnne and I made the most of what we had and did Chinese New Years up right. First we visited the Chinese Gardens at Darling Harbor where for $10 AUD you can dress up like an Emperor or Empress and have your photo taken at various places in the garden by the staff there. It&amp;#8217;s sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we visited Chinatown to breath some black-powder saturated air &amp;#8211; and take in a fireworks display and some Dragon dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we rounded out our New Years Day by having some tasty vegetarian Chinese. All in all a most propitious start to our new year, even without the Dragon boats!&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be aware that Dave has always dreamed of riding a mechanical bull.  Well his dream came true just the other day!  No, it wasn&amp;#8217;t at some dirty, dusty saloon somewhere in the middle of the Outback.  Much better, it was at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Fair! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were en route to Newtown, a funky little Sydney neighborhood, when we came across the festivities at a local park.  We meandered through the fair listening to the rockin&amp;#8217; music of a band that may have starred in Priscilla Queen of the Desert, trying not too look too embarrassed as we walked past the &amp;#8220;Sydney Gay Nudists,&amp;#8221; when we spotted the lonely mechanical bull booth in the far corner.  Dave never hesitated, and I never laughed so hard!  See for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A really fun part of life down here is that ever major city has an outdoor movie venue and most weeknight during the year you can go to the city park, pack a picnic and see a film under the stars. It&amp;#8217;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moonlightmovies.com.au&quot;&gt;Moonlight Movies&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#8217;s kind of like DC&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Screen on the Green&amp;#8221;, but the movies don&amp;#8217;t suck and some times they&amp;#8217;re films still in theaters, some times they&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8220;recent classics&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend is Sydney we had a chance to catch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tropfest.com&quot;&gt;Topfest&lt;/a&gt;. A very cool short film contest (no film can be over seven minutes long) that takes entries from around Australia. This weekend they showed the 16 finalists at the Sydney Domain. So it&amp;#8217;s a full evening of entrainment for free and if you aren&amp;#8217;t into the film just wait &amp;#8211; there will be another one on in 7 minutes or less.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Zealand Notes for Budget Travelers</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/new-zealand-notes-for-budget-travelers.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/new-zealand-notes-for-budget-travelers</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of you are probably wondering how the heck we are making our money stretch around the world. The answer is on a budget! As we planned and planned and then planned some more prior the trip, we did our best to estimate our costs from everything to tickets and visas and travel insurance to daily costs and special, one-time expenses like tours. For each country, we&amp;#8217;ve established a daily rate for the both of us. For more expensive countries (or comparable to the U.S.), we&amp;#8217;ve set out a rather tight daily allowance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving in New Zealand as our first destination on the grand world tour was both good and bad. On the positive side, it was easy to travel here. Everyone speaks English and the place was built for tourism. On the negative side, it was a hard landing for our budget. It definitely took us a couple of weeks to sink into a pattern of not eating out and nickel and diming ourselves to death. At home, we are in the habit of eating out frequently and even when you travel on a 2-3 week trip, you would eat most meals out. Well unless you have loads of cash, you don&amp;#8217;t do that every day on a round the world trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you&amp;#8217;re interested in budget travel in NZ, here are a few things we learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Though the country is small, it can take some time and money to get around to the most remote and interesting places. I would really not plan a trip here for under four weeks. Take your time, get your own mode of transport and do it the way you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The best way to go for us was with car and tent. We scored a super cheap car rental (approx. $14/day) that was very economical on gas. We travelled almost 4000 km and spent about $250 on gas. Not too bad. The camper-vans are a very popular rental option and probably great if it&amp;#8217;s cold and wet and you don&amp;#8217;t want to deal with bringing a tent, sleeping bag, etc. They are also equipped for cooking which is a bonus. For us, at this time of year, the price would have been about 5-6 times more than the car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Lodging was easily one of our largest expenses &amp;#8211; mostly in the cities. We opted for private double rooms, rather than shared dorms in the hostels. It was extremely difficult for us to stay on our daily budget when we were in cities. In contrast, it was quite easy to be under budget when we were camping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Caravan parks are everywhere and are certainly cheaper than hostels and hotels. They have full kitchens, often with all the utensils you need. Most also have basic cabins which can be a great bargain.  A little more than a tent site for two and far less than a hostel.  For us, it allowed us to dry out the tent and sleep in a bed from time to time.  Even cheaper and typically more scenic than caravan parks are Department of Conservation or DOC sites. You usually have to have your own cooking supplies, but they almost all have toilets and water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Come during the non-peak season. We were here during the high season with half of Germany. As to be expected, prices are higher. We&amp;#8217;ve heard reports of rentals and lodging being heavily discounted with many fewer tourists later in the year. You may have to forgo warm, summer weather, but as far as we can tell, that wouldn&amp;#8217;t mean much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Restaurants are expensive &amp;#8211; even by our standards at home. When we did eat out it was usually at a take away type joint with falafel or a veggie burger. Grocery stores even in the smallest town had a decent selection of food (even tofu) and for us we could cook more balanced and interesting meals cheaper than we could eat out. Our other little find &amp;#8211; as bad as this may sound &amp;#8211; was food courts. In both Dunedin and Auckland we found very good and very cheap Indian food at the local mall food court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Skip the tours or at least be selective.  You could spend thousands in New Zealand on sightseeing flights, skydiving, bungy jumping, zorbing, glacier hiking.  We skipped most and don&amp;#8217;t feel like we missed out on anything.  We had originally planned to hike the glacier, but for the cost we would have had very little time on the ice.  At Franz, we basically did the same hike up to the face as every tour.  No, we didn&amp;#8217;t put on the crampons and walk on the ice, but we enjoyed it just the same. Again, for the kind of trip we&amp;#8217;re taking we have to decide which experiences really add to our experience and are unique to the place we&amp;#8217;re visiting.  You could argue that AJ Hackett&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211; home of the original bungy jump &amp;#8211; is unique to NZ, but watching those silly people jump off the bridge was more than adequate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  When planning a trip like this, don&amp;#8217;t forget to budget for the miscellaneous little things. They add up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Get a job. If you&amp;#8217;ve got the time and feel like experiencing a country without blowing all your cash, this is a great place to make some cash (seems like fruit pickers are in demand) or even subsidize your stay with a few hours of cleaning at the hostel. This wasn&amp;#8217;t in our plans, but had NZ been later in our itinerary it may have been.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Hei konā rā New Zealand</title>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/hei-kona-ra-new-zealand</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we say goodbye to New Zealand and the lovely Kiwis (people, fruit and birds) and head for Oz. New Zealand has been good to us. It&amp;#8217;s a beautiful country to tour, and I imagine one of the easiest places in the world to travel. We&amp;#8217;ve been very fortunate to experience the kindness of old and new friends who&amp;#8217;ve offered us a place to stay, food, laundry and even hauled us and all our crap around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met Michelle, Richard, Griffin &amp;#038; Buckley in Christchurch through the Eugene connection (i.e. Deb &amp;#038; Craig). They&amp;#8217;ve just relocated to Christchurch and even before their furniture arrived were open to hosting two complete strangers. They had their own great travel stories to share and also started us on our quest to see Comet McNaught. Unfortunately we never seemed to be anywhere with clear, unobstructed skies, though we did catch a faded glimmer of it near Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through yet another friendly connection, we met Dan, Cecile and Andrew and enjoyed the ocean view from their pad in Paikakariki just north of Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we caught up with Dave&amp;#8217;s friend Sarah from GMU days. Sarah, her hubby Mel, daughter Leah and mum Sue, were great fun. They shared their beautiful corner of the country with us &amp;#8211; the Bay of Islands &amp;#8211; and gave us a small taste of local life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine we will miss this easy going, friendly country and its amazing scenery, but not the numerous one bridges and endless switchbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Kiwis go on vacation they go to Northland. It&amp;#8217;s the peninsula north of Auckland, and you&amp;#8217;re sandwiched in between the South Pacific and the Tasman sea, so there are loads of beach options. It&amp;#8217;s where most of the Maori population is located these days too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been bouncing around up here visiting Russell &amp;#8211; the original capital of the country &amp;#8211; now a sleepy resort town in the beautiful Bay of Islands, Cape Keri Keri, a peninsula jutting out into the South Pacific up near the very top of the North Island, and the Waipoua forest over on the west coast &amp;#8211; home to the Kauri. Kauri&amp;#8217;s are kind of like New Zealand&amp;#8217;s version of a Redwoods, huge and very old.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/spotted-930-club-guy-in-auckland</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So LeeAnne and I are back in Auckland briefly before we head north to visit Sarah. We&amp;#8217;re here primarily to finally pick up our tickets and run a few other errands around town. So after we&amp;#8217;ve finished our business we&amp;#8217;re walking down by the harbor right around sunset and we approach a big guy on the sidewalk. He&amp;#8217;s wearing a black t-shirt and those 3/4 length pants and he looks tough, he has a bunch of tattoos and face piercings and he kind of looks like he should be &amp;#8230;at the 9:30 Club in Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LeeAnne points this out to me. And for a second we have a conversation: &amp;#8220;Sure it&amp;#8217;s him!&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;No way&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;How could it be?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, as we pass him LeeAnne says to no one in particular &amp;#8220;I love the 9:30 Club!&amp;#8221; and now there&amp;#8217;s no doubt &amp;#8211; the guy looks back at us and says something to his friends. Instead of doing anything else &amp;#8211; like asking him why he&amp;#8217;s there or getting a picture &amp;#8211; we just press on. But I&amp;#8217;d still like to know what he&amp;#8217;s up too down here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>That Smell: Rotorua</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/that-smell-rotorua.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/that-smell-rotorua</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rotorua stinks, literally (some may say figuratively too, but that&amp;#8217;s another entry all together) it&amp;#8217;s the center of a lot of geothermal activity here on the North Island. There are geysers and steam and the smell of rotten eggs all over up here. You really can&amp;#8217;t get away from it once you&amp;#8217;r here &amp;#8211; the sulfury rotten egg smell that is. I&amp;#8217;m reminded of that line from &amp;#8220;The Matrix&amp;#8221; when Agent Smith is explaining to Morpheus why he&amp;#8217;s such a grouch: he says &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the smell! I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I&amp;#8217;ve somehow been infected by it.&amp;#8221; Did I mention Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) grew up in New Zealand? It&amp;#8217;s all coming together isn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I swear this place is ready to pop any minute. There are steam vents all over town, releasing the pressure from under parking lots and peoples back yards. There was an explosion in a park in town during the &amp;#8217;90&amp;#8217;s that sent debris 200 meters in the air for gosh sakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why on earth did we spend two days here? Well, in addition to being the center of geothermal activity, Rotorua is just the center of a lot of activity in general. It kind of bills itself as kind of a Queenstown North. If you want to do a bunch of bungy jumping and skydiving and other &amp;#8220;Adventure&amp;#8221; type stuff, but don&amp;#8217;t want to go to the South Island &amp;#8211; you go to Rotorua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brought LeeAnne and I here is the same thing that brings Japanese tourists in by the bus loads &amp;#8211; hot spring spas. We went to the Polynesian Spa in town &amp;#8211; there are several to choose from in the area. They had pools ranging from around 95 degrees to about 102. It&amp;#8217;s situated right on the lake and the view is wonderful &amp;#8211; the sulfur smell is terrible &amp;#8211; in fact we probably smelled terrible after we left, but when in Rome huh?&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the same time LeeAnne and I are doing our around the world travel my cousin &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jawolf.com/sam/&quot;&gt;Sam Forrest&lt;/a&gt; is doing something very similar. Last I had heard he was in South America so I never really even thought about the possibility that our paths might cross, but small world that it is, it seems he jumped over the Pacific by way of the Galapagos and Easter Island and was in Auckland when we were in Wellington &amp;#8211; opposite sides of the North Island. Unfortunitly Sammy travels a little faster than we do, so he was on his way to Singapore before we had a chance to get back up to Auckland. Next time Sam, next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he has a new web site to &lt;a herf=&quot;http://www.jawolf.com/samf/&quot;&gt;document his travels&lt;/a&gt; as well as his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jawolf.com/sam/woodcraft.htm&quot;&gt;woodwork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Wild West Coast</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/the-wild-west-coast.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/the-wild-west-coast</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After touring the Lakes District and Fiordland, we headed over Haast Pass to the west coast, described as wild and quite wet by most brochures and guidebooks. The drive over Haast was on one of our first clear, sunny days. For the first time, you could see the snowy peaks and brilliant blue sky. As you descend towards the west coast of the South Island, at some point the landscape changes drastically from green mountain forest to lush rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you head north along the coast, there are virtually no services for miles.  Our trek thus far had been back to back camper-van and rental car peppered with some inexperienced cycling groups wobbling all over the lane (I&amp;#8217;m sure we didn&amp;#8217;t do that).  As we headed towards the glaciers, we saw barely a car.  Just green, green forest hovering around the roadway.  The blue skies faded and the weather turned damp and overcast meeting all our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coast north of the glaciers doesn&amp;#8217;t disappoint either.  There are a few slightly larger towns (by larger I mean a population of more than 3,000) which offer a feel of what daily Kiwi life is like and some beautiful coastline.  We chose to stop at the rather small town of Punakaiki, home to the Pancake Rocks &amp;#8211; columns of limestone resembling stacks of pancakes &amp;#8211;  and a quiet little beachfront hostel where you can pitch a tent for cheap.  We enjoyed the quiet beach and our first sunset over the Tasman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Ice Storm: Glacier Country</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/the-ice-storm-glacier-country.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/the-ice-storm-glacier-country</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Traveling up the West Coast of the South Island we did hikes to the Ice faces of two of the biggest glaciers in New Zealand Fox Glacier and Franz Joseph Glacier. I&amp;#8217;d never seen glaciers except on TV before and the experience was well worth the trip out. The two glaciers are only about 23 km apart and there is precious little else out there. It&amp;#8217;s about 120 km north or south before your reach the next village or gas station &amp;#8211; in fact the road to them was only completed in the &amp;#8217;70&amp;#8217;s. Since then there&amp;#8217;s been a rush of tourists (like us) and two little kind of high-end towns have grown up around the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franz Josef is the smaller of the two we saw, but easily the most touristy. Several tour companies offer to take folks up on the ice &amp;#8211; in the hour and a half we were there we saw maybe 5 tours starting. I have to say, maybe it was because we went there first, maybe it was because the footpath to the ice face was washed out and we had to climb over rocks and through streams (and through roped off areas that had warning signs posted not to go any further) but Franz was more fun to get to and had some more dramatic views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox Glacier is the larger glacier, but it&amp;#8217;s much less commercial than Franz Josef and a lot easier to get to. There&amp;#8217;s only one tour company permitted to operate on Fox and the effects of that are really apparent both in the park and the village below it, it&amp;#8217;s a lot less congested and there are a lot fewer people in both. It&amp;#8217;s much more relaxing, and there&amp;#8217;s a walking path that puts you about 40 meters from the face of it, so it&amp;#8217;s very easy to get some great views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glaciers were definitely a highlight of the trip for me and I&amp;#8217;d make the drive out there again in a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Serious LOTR Country &#8211; Milford Sound</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/serious-lotr-country-milford-sound.html"/>
        <updated>2007-02-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/serious-lotr-country-milford-sound</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fjordland &amp;#8211; the southwestern corner of the South Island &amp;#8211; feels very different from the rest of the country. For one thing it&amp;#8217;s almost all a huge temperate rain forest. So you&amp;#8217;ll have a forest of conifers littered with huge ferns, and these crazy mountains that don&amp;#8217;t belong in the Lord of the Rings &amp;#8211; they&amp;#8217;re the source material for it. It&amp;#8217;s hard to stop thinking about the movies here &amp;#8211; there are reminders all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milford is a very isolated corner of Fjordland. There&amp;#8217;s one road in and it&amp;#8217;s probably one of the most dramatic/terrifying drives of my life. You pass a series of huge mountains and cross over several huge ones on the way. Then the clincher &amp;#8211; just when you think you can&amp;#8217;t go any higher (you can&amp;#8217;t) you have to drive through a one way tunnel, that has no lights and is on an incline so you can&amp;#8217;t see the end &amp;#8211; talk about the gates to Mordor &amp;#8211; and get this it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8230;one way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;One Way&amp;#8221; you say, &amp;#8220;No&amp;#8221;! Yes, in fifteen minute intervals it&amp;#8217;s one way each way. If it takes you more than fifteen minutes to make the trip, get ready to share the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were there just after a rainfall and there were literally thousands of waterfalls of every size. Quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a small boat tour &amp;#8211; small being 75 people and it was quite nice. The captain took us in under a few waterfalls and got us quite close to the native wildlife &amp;#8211; seals and dolphins. I&amp;#8217;d recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camping in a rain forest, no I won&amp;#8217;t recommend that. We stayed at the Milford Sound Lodge and got a tent site. Which was very soon a very wet tent site. That I would not do again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course we had our first encounter with the notorious Kea. Known to Kiwi&amp;#8217;s as the &amp;#8220;Bossiest Bird in the World&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s the worlds only Alpine Parrot &amp;#8211; there was a sign at the hostel warning visitor that &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;If you feed a Kea dinner, they will eat your car for desert.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s true, they evolved on an island that has no predators and their quite big, so they have no fear of humans.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lake Tekapo</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first stop in our career as car campers is Lake Tekapo &amp;#8211; a wonderfully blue-blue (almost phony looking) lake in the Southern Alps. We&amp;#8217;re also at a pretty high altitude, and the lake is rather remote so residents of the lake area claim to have the clearest sky&amp;#8217;s in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly for us, the night that we we there it was rather cloudy but there were moments when the full moon was reflected on the lake &amp;#8211; creepy! And cold &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s the raw end of being so high up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Diary of a Car Camper &#8211; New Zealand</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/diary-of-a-car-camper-south-island.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/diary-of-a-car-camper-south-island</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re starting kind of a second leg of our stay here in New Zealand, the bikes are gone and we&amp;#8217;re renting a car for the rest of the trip. Of course it&amp;#8217;s going to give our legs a break and let us have a lot more range in terms of where we can go and what we can see in a day. But it will also help us out in other ways &amp;#8211; when we were on bikes we could really only buy enough food to get us through the day, now we can get a cooler and buy stuff that will last us a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got really lucky on the rental. We were looking for a two week, one way rental from Christchurch to Auckland, and expecting to pay extra for the one way bit. But, it seems Christchurch has too many rentals and Auckland too few &amp;#8211; so we&amp;#8217;re getting a car that normally rents for 49 NZD for 19 NZD (About 14 USD), and it comes with unlimited mileage and insurance. What a bargain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, a bargain. The downside is it&amp;#8217;s a 1996 Toyota Corolla that I can only imagine has flipped it&amp;#8217;s odometer about a dozen times. And while it has radio and tape player, it has only one speaker &amp;#8211; you read that right. It&amp;#8217;s not that the other speakers don&amp;#8217;t work. It shipped from the factory with only one speaker &amp;#8211; who could ask for anything more? When you&amp;#8217;re in the drivers seat and you have the system cranked you can kind of hear the tinny treble bits of the music that&amp;#8217;s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving is a lot easier than riding, but at the end of the day it&amp;#8217;s actually more tiring I think. We&amp;#8217;ve done several long days already &amp;#8211; with more to come &amp;#8211; and I have to say when driving you still end the day and feel like you need a nap, but you don&amp;#8217;t have the sense of accomplishment or the endorphins you have when you complete a day of bike riding. Of well, they&amp;#8217;re small islands, but we still need the car to see everything we want to on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well be having some long days from Christchurch we&amp;#8217;ll jump down to Milford Sound then up the West Coast of the South Island, then back over to the east where we take a ferry back to the North Island. You get the picture. Luckily the miles are included.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cycling New Zealand &#8211; That&#8217;s a Wrap</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/cycling-new-zealand-thats-a-wrap.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/cycling-new-zealand-thats-a-wrap</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are back in Christchurch finally, after spending the past few weeks biking the South Island. From here we rent a car and head to the west coast over the mountains and then back up to the North Island. We consider ourselves much wiser now, if you, or someone you love is entertaining the idea of cycling in New Zealand we offer a few humble suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If you can, bring your own bike &amp;#8211; We couldn&amp;#8217;t and it hurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If you can&amp;#8217;t bring your own bike, rent something very similar to what you ride at home &amp;#8211; We ride road bikes at home but rented (very nice) hybrids. Trouble is we found that once you&amp;#8217;re use to a road bike, it&amp;#8217;s hard to go back to that hybrid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Crazy steep hills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Traffic &amp;#8211; The road system down here is not as well developed as it is in North America or Europe. There are fewer roads and fewer routes; you will be sharing the blacktop with logging trucks, semi&amp;#8217;s, emergency vehicles and tourists in camper-vans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Finally, if you can get past all the other stuff, there are a lot of magnificent views, great wildlife to see, and very nice people to meet along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two highlights of the last leg of the journey (back up the east coast) were certainly the boulders at Moeraki, and the blue penguins of Oamaru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boulders at Moeraki are technically &amp;#8220;septarian concretions&amp;#8221;, the crud from the magma vents of dead volcanos. They&amp;#8217;re about 60 million years old and they look like 40 or 50 bowling balls (5 foot tall bowling balls) sitting on the beach, partially concealed in the tide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oamaru is home to a colony of blue penguins. Just after dusk you can go down to a place between the docks and an old quarry and watch them surf in in groups or 10 or 15 apiece. The night we were there I think we saw 40 or more come on shore and waddle into the bush where they make their nests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oamaru itself is a really terrific old port town just north of Dunedin. All of the buildings in the downtown area were built from a white limestone quarry just outside of town around the end of the 19th century and there is a very fin-de-siecle vibe in the town. At night you feel like you&amp;#8217;ve been dropped onto a period movie set. I wish we could have stayed longer to get a better look at the place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re like me, watching Willy Wonka &amp;#038; the Chocolate Factory (the original with Gene Wilder) when you were a kid was a little disturbing.  Our tour of Cadbury World in Dunedin proved to be full of a little of that same creepiness as well as loads of chocolate goodness!  Our guide Colleen, clad in purple overalls and matching purple shoes, welcomed us to the tour with a lovely hairnet and a plastic bag to fill with a sampling of the many Cadbury bars produced there.  Living in the U.S. we certainly are not at a loss for good chocolate (according to Colleen Americans consume 16 kilos each year!), but we really are missing out on a huge variety of silly named Cadbury candy bars.  With names like Pinky, Crunchie, Dream and Curly Wurly how can you go wrong?  And some of them are quite tasty! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour culminates with a 4 story, one ton chocolate waterfall.  Though it was no surprise, I still couldn&amp;#8217;t refrain from bursting into giddy laughter.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether it was the silliness of it or sheer pleasure.  The creepy part enters next when Colleen proceeds to make us cant &amp;#8220;I love chocolate&amp;#8221; inside the hollow silo.  It was like Willy Wonka at Latin Mass.  Weird!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dunedin &#8211; San Francisco of the South?</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/dunedin-steepest-city-in-the-world.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/dunedin-steepest-city-in-the-world</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New Zealand is a very hilly place. Dunedin is the MOST hilly place we have been yet in the country. In fact it&amp;#8217;s the home of the steepest street in the world &amp;#8211; Baldwin Street. And the motorway in to town &amp;#8211; the main artery for cars trucks etc. in or out, is built on a crazy 11% grade. Have these people never heard of tunnels? Throw me a bone here. Anyway, it almost makes you think that the founders of this place weren&amp;#8217;t that concerned with the rest of New Zealand, and for todays residents that may still be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunedin is called the &amp;#8220;Edinborough of the South&amp;#8221;, which I guess makes sense as Dunedin (pronounced as if you were saying &amp;#8220;Ma, I&amp;#8217;m done eatin&amp;#39;&amp;#8221; really fast) is the original Gaelic name of Edinburgh &amp;#8211; before the English made &amp;#8216;em change it ya see. And while I&amp;#8217;ve never been to Edinburgh, this place does remind me of a city in the U.S. with stupid steep hills, built around a harbor, home to a chocolate factory, with lots of art-school students: San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me there&amp;#8217;s not a resemblance! The hills, the harbor, Dunedin is home to the New Zealand franchise of the Cadbury Empire and the largest university in New Zealand. Now just try to remember what SF was like before the dot coms arrived, shrink it down by a factor of 5, and make it Scottish &amp;#8211; ladies and gents I give you Dunedin!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Big Birds, Sleepy Sealions and Super Cute Penguins</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/big-birds-sleepy-sealions-and-super-cute-penguins.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/big-birds-sleepy-sealions-and-super-cute-penguins</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we threw the budget out and splurged for our first tour in New Zealand. Actually, it was quite a bargain and worth every penny!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stretching out from the Dunedin coast is the Otago Peninsula. As with much of the geography round these parts, it was formed by a volcano many, many, many years ago. At the very tip of the peninsula is the Taiaroa Head &amp;#8211; home to the only mainland colony of Royal Albatross in the world. During our visit to the Southland Museum in Invercargill (aka Invercrappy &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=36&quot;&gt;per Dave&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt;), we saw three of these massive birds on display. (They had been unfortunate enough to meet with the wrong side of a fisherman&amp;#8217;s net.) It took a few minutes to really grasp what I was seeing. These birds are unbelievably huge. They were so big, it was almost cartoonish. To add to the experience, the display also had a rather creepy recording of the calls they make. I could have lived without that. Either way, after seeing them stuffed, we were curious to see these creatures live and in flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Elm Wildlife Tour was recommended to us by the friendly Kiwi managing our hostel. They have a backpacker rate (excellent!) and in addition to driving you to the albatross colony will take you to a reserve that they manage to see other cute little Kiwi critters up close and personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a brief minute, Dave and I considered riding our bikes out to the center along the coastal road, but after the previous day&amp;#8217;s hike-n-bike up Three Mile Hill, I was more than happy to take a bus! Once we saw the crazy, narrow, windy road, we were especially happy with our decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First stop was the Royal Albatross Center. According to the guides, you have a pretty good chance of seeing them in flight when it&amp;#8217;s windy. Funny, I understood windy to be a permanent weather condition here, but perhaps I am mistaken. As we pulled into the parking lot, an albatross was flying overhead. Really awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Albatross is the largest of the world&amp;#8217;s seabirds. It can measure up to 1.2 meters and has a wing span of 3.3 meters. They are incredibly efficient birds using the wind like a glider to carry them for thousands of miles out to sea before returning back to breed. Though there were many seagulls and spotted shags (quite a nice bird as well) roosting along the cliffs and flying overhead, it was easy to tell the albatross by its size of course and by their glide. They really soar on the wind. No flapping necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After gawking at these surreal birds and watching an entertaining sea-lion in a fish feeding frenzy in the bay below us, we boarded our little bus and set off for their private reserve on the eastern side of the peninsula. Along the way we spotted black swans, pukekos (a deep blue bird also known as a swamp hen), pied stilts, white faced herons, black-backed gulls and little shags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group of about 8 folks went with one of the guides down a rather steep hillside to a viewing hut just above a colony of New Zealand fur seals lounging along the rocky shore. We observed the females with their pups playfully splashing in the pools. Very cute. The hut was set up to view them from a comfortable distance, as the fur seal doesn&amp;#8217;t take to kindly to people getting too close. Fortunately for the fur seal, they have been recolonized quite successfully and have seen a population increase after being hunted to near extinction by European seal hunters in the previous century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hiking back up the windy headland, we ventured down the other side to a beach where we walked right up to a group of sleepy Hooker sea-lions. The Hooker sea-lion is the rarest of the world&amp;#8217;s five species of sea-lions and are endemic to New Zealand. They are apparently making a comeback after being eliminated by Maori hunting centuries ago. Unlike the fur seals, these guys like company and are known to be gregarious. Our guide had studied the sea-lions for his masters degree and was very diligent about preventing any of us (like the two mischievous German boys) from getting too close. When asked what they would do, he said that they would most likely just run at you to see you run, but their bite can leave a nasty bruise. You might think you could just outrun one of these big, lazy looking guys, but think again! They can run up to 20kph. No worries mate! These guys were busy resting up for a night of prowling the ocean waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further down the beach, we could see a wee little yellow-eyed penguin making his way onto shore. We walked down the beach and were able to observe the penguins from a few viewing huts. Like the fur seals, these guys are a little on the nervous side. Who can blame them? The big guys down the beach would be happy to have them for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched as slowly, one by one, the penguins popped out of the water and waddled over to the hillside where they would hop and jump their way to the nest and chicks they had left behind that morning. Yellow-eyed penguins are the rarest of the world&amp;#8217;s 18 species of penguins and also found only in New Zealand. They were named Hoiho or noise shouter by the Maori for the loud, distinctive call &amp;#8211; which we were fortunate to hear a few times. They nest in coastal vegetation and forest where they can hide from their neighbors. According to our guide they can swim 15 &amp;#8211; 20 kilometers out to sea and then back again each day. You have to wonder how they know how to get home. Quite amazing creatures!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every day you can see rare animals up close in their own habitat. All in all, pretty awesome day!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Somewhere Between Clinton and Gore</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/somewhere-between-clinton-and-gore.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/somewhere-between-clinton-and-gore</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So we are back on the road cycling. This time we are lighter (we dropped a bunch of stuff off with acquaintances in Christchurch), smarter (we&amp;#8217;ve traveled south by bus and are riding north to keep the wind at our backs), and more motivated (if you read our post on &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=36&quot;&gt;Invercargill&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;#8217;ll understand, we need to get out of here!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terrain here in the Southland is relatively flat to rolling hills. It reminds me a lot of the Ozarks. The domed hills will also be familiar to anyone that has spent much time in front of a Windows XP machine. You know the desktop wallpaper that it ships with? The one with the grass hills that strech on forever? The too perfect curve of the hills into the meadow? I could give you a million photos like that from Southland &amp;#8230;but they would all have sheep on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in the &amp;#8220;Roaring &amp;#8217;40&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; down here, and the winds do roar &amp;#8230;at our backs. It&amp;#8217;s been some easy riding (by design if I do say so myself). In fact just like Camelot, it only rains here after dark. No really, it has rained on us almost every night since we arrived in Invercargill &amp;#8230;but only after say 6:30 or so. Very convenient. Then every morning around say 5:30 or so there&amp;#8217;s a big wind storm that rolls through and drys everything out. How could I make this up? If man ever figures out how to control the weather, I would say we follow the model they use down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the thing about this route is that it takes us through two neighboring towns with cosmically coincidental names: Clinton and Gore. They&amp;#8217;re about 40k apart from one another, and for some reason during the &amp;#8217;90&amp;#8217;s the road signs between these two towns were being stolen at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gore is the bigger of the two. Apparently there is great Brown Trout fishing there &amp;#8211; they claim to be simultaneously the Trout Fishing Capitol of the World, and the Country Music Capitol of New Zealand (I couldn&amp;#8217;t get anyone to comment on whether or not they invented the Internet in Gore). But it is the home of the Gore Library, which may be as close as Al ever gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinton is by it&amp;#8217;s own admission only a three horse town &amp;#8211; they have a statue in the middle of town of three horses &amp;#8211; not much else besides that really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s it. The only drama on this leg of the ride is that I broke a spoke (never done that before) and rode about a day on it before we found a guy that does small motor and bike repair in Balclutha. He put in a new spoke and trued the wheel. Onward to Dunedin!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Invercargill Nights</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/invercargill-nights.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/invercargill-nights</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Legend of Burt Munro&lt;/strong&gt; 
Have you seen the movie &amp;#8220;The Worlds Fastest Indian&amp;#8221;? It&amp;#8217;s the true story of an elderly Kiwi who breaks the world speed record for motorcycles at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah at the ripe old age of 69. The Kiwi, played by Anthony Hopkins, is named Burt Munro and he&amp;#8217;s from Invercargill, a town at the very bottom of the South Island, and that&amp;#8217;s where we right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say Invercargill is isolated is a bit of an understatement. In New Zealand, one of the most geographically isolated places in the world, North Islanders think of South Islanders as a little backward and behind the times. On the South Island, the citizens of Christchurch look down their noses at people in Dunedin, Dunedin in turn has Invercargill to poke fun at. Do you see where I&amp;#8217;m going here? Invercargill is the end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invercargill is Invercrappy&lt;/strong&gt; 
So what&amp;#8217;s at the end of the line, and why are we here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s answer the last question first. We&amp;#8217;ve bussed down here from Christchurch and we&amp;#8217;ll start cycling back there in the morning (If you look at the prevailing winds it makes sense. If you have felt these winds, as we have, it will make perfect sense), We&amp;#8217;ve given up on trying to do a circuit of the South Island (Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://gothereandback.com/?p=29&quot;&gt;LeeAnne&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; for details), in favor of cycling it&amp;#8217;s length instead. From Christchurch we&amp;#8217;ll rent a car and be car-camping the rest of our time in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, back to what is in Invercargill. The short answer is: very little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I take that back, there is a very nice museum with some of the best, and most well explained, Maori artifacts we&amp;#8217;ve seen yet. It also has a very interesting exhibit on shipwrecks and castaways in the Southern Ocean for any of you waiting for &amp;#8220;Lost&amp;#8221; to start up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that it has alot of stores that aren&amp;#8217;t open, Bogens (What we would call Grits or Heads) and not much else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there isn&amp;#8217;t a lot for Invercarglians to toot their horn about. Or there wasn&amp;#8217;t until this movie came out (And it&amp;#8217;s really a good movie, I&amp;#8217;d see it again). Now those folks up in Dunedin may still have a laugh at Invercargill&amp;#8217;s expense, but who&amp;#8217;s got the movie under their belt? That&amp;#8217;s right. Invercrappy, I mean Invercargill.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Christchurch &#8230;or Disneyland?</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/christchurch-or-disneyland.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/christchurch-or-disneyland</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I once had a conversation with an Australian woman about the nature of Kiwi&amp;#8217;s, &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re more British than the British she said.&amp;#8221; Now, asking an Australian to define the nature of a Kiwi (or vice versa) is never recommended, and you shouldn&amp;#8217;t expect an unbiased answer, but in the case of Christchurch &amp;#8230;she may have been on to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stepped into a transporter and were told you were being dropped into say, Oxford England but ended up in Christchurch, it may take you a while to put things together. There&amp;#8217;s a huge Gothic cathedral in the middle of town, most of the buildings are appropriately quaint, there are wonderful hedgerows all over. In fact they may be doing England better than the English. It&amp;#8217;s like visiting a Disney version of England on the Canterbury Plains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, they&amp;#8217;ve removed all of the mountains! There are no mountains here, unlike everywhere else we&amp;#8217;ve been in New Zealand. Sure they say it&amp;#8217;s the effect of a huge geological shift in continental plates, induction zones and all that, but I know better. They just wanted to simulate the English countryside a little more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A telling sign of the Disney influence is the fact that there are street performers everywhere! Everywhere I tel ya. I defy you to walk through a public place &amp;#8211; the City Center or a pedestrian mall without being entertained by a mime, juggler or performance artist. Surely part of this is due to the fact that we&amp;#8217;re here during the start of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldbuskersfestival.com/&quot;&gt;World Buskers Festival&lt;/a&gt;, a festival of and for street performers from all over the world, but that can&amp;#8217;t explain it all away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, good on ya for Christchurch Kiwi&amp;#8217;s! You deserve a big slap on the back and a pint.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pedal, Pedal, Pedal</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/pedal-pedal-pedal.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/pedal-pedal-pedal</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So our plan for a while has been to bike while in New Zealand. After considerable research and contemplation, we decided to rent bikes and bike on the South Island only. According to all reports, 3/4 of the people live on the North Island and hence there is much less traffic on the South Island. We also realized that with all the gear and the terrain we would not be able to do it all. Little did we know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the pleasures of the undulating roads of the South Island, let me fill you in on the bike rentals. I think one lesson we are both taking from this experience is that it is much better, if possible, to tour on your own bike. That said, we knew it could be extremely costly to ship our bikes back to the U.S. We had made arrangements with a shop, which will remain nameless, in Auckland that came recommended from a few sources. Dave had been corresponding with the shop owner for a month or so prior to our departure. We had requested road style touring bikes rather than hybrids or mountain bikes. We had also requested triple chain rings. (If you are not a cyclist, note that this is absolutely critical for hauling my big bum and associated gear up very steep hills.) Based on the shop&amp;#8217;s communications with us, we had a clear sense that the bikes would be on the older side (How does your wife feel about shifters on the down tube?), but felt pretty confident in him based on the questions he was asking and his general attitude towards working with us. I suppose I should also add that this shop was also the cheapest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on our first day in Auckland, we went in search of the bike shop anxious to check out the bikes and get them suited up with our pedals, seats, etc. We turned the corner near the shop and both nearly burst out laughing. The highly recommended bike shop was a plain, little, white, one-car garage on a residential street. With a raised eyebrow and a hope that this added character to the experience, we walked on over. The shop owner happily greeted us and took us out back to show us what he had for us. He instructed his assistant to get the bikes they had talked about for us. I think, though I am not 100% certain, that he went behind a shed and pulled bikes off of a pile. What he produced was well worn with a rusted chain and a double chain ring. Mine was also uncomfortably big for me, though the owner didn&amp;#8217;t seem to think so. Dave&amp;#8217;s bike was in a similar condition and also with a double. The shop owner initially resisted changing out the doubles for us then after some consideration said he would do so the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a moment of disappointment and &amp;#8216;now what do we do?&amp;#8217;, we did some research and ended up canceling with our friend the next day. Thankfully, he had not requested any payment up front. We ended up going with an operation based in Christchurch that runs tours and rents bikes. They could have two bikes set up for us in Wellington the following week. A little more money, but it felt a little more reliable. In the process, we had to forgo road touring bikes for hybrids. Still seemed like the best option at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we did pick up the bikes as planned. Even a day earlier than planned. We loaded them up good (and I mean good and heavy) and headed off on the ferry to the South Island. We met some other cyclists at the ferry and heard some of their tales of riding the North Island and learned some highlights of the South Island from a super friendly British couple who had travelled there before. The following day we set off down the eastern side of the island from Picton toward Christchurch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to leaving Wellington, Dave and I had spent a couple of hours planning out our route, ensuring time off for a few highlights and trying to be realistic about how many kilometers we could cover a day with all the gear. What we have learned since then is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  heavy hybrids with fat tires are slower than road bikes with skinny tires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  we have too much weight on our bikes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  the NZ transportation department didn&amp;#8217;t care about grading the road when it comes to hills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  the roads, though paved, are something like a nice country road in Ohio (not exactly smooth) &amp;#8211; except there are tour buses and double trailer semis passing you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Lee Anne was REALLY not in shape for this (ok this is not really new information, but it has definitely been confirmed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  this is a really beautiful country with lots of friendly folks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say the latter now that we have arrived in Christchurch, spent a day off the bike and given my very sore bum a rest. I&amp;#8217;ll spare you the details of the sore bum, but&amp;#8217;s let&amp;#8217;s just say it&amp;#8217;s not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, the ride has been much more challenging than we both anticipated. There is more traffic on the South Island than anticipated, some of the climbs are excruciatingly steep and we are making very slow time. I never knew I could actually ride this slow! So, once again, we&amp;#8217;re in the process of adapting and being flexible. We&amp;#8217;re planning to comprise our plans a little and pedal on for a couple more weeks than possible cover a few of the South Island sites by car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll see how it all works out. You know what they say, &amp;#8220;a day on the bike is better than a day in the office.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Night in the Jailhouse</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/one-night-in-the-jailhouse.html"/>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An unexpected end to our second day of riding was that LeeAnne and I spent the night in the jailhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chevoit (Pronounced Chevy-Ut) Motel is built on the grounds of the old Cheviot jailhouse &amp;#8211; which still stands. In fact you can rent a cell in the jailhouse for a very reasonable fee, and that&amp;#8217;s just what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room is a jail cell &amp;#8211; real bars, real locks on the door and eerily, real scratch and claw marks on the door, as well as some graffiti cut into the walls and door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the grounds of the hotel were perfectly normal &amp;#8211; no diversion from the norm here in New Zealand in any way. Just this curious old jailhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hobbits &#038; Elves</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/hobbits-elves.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/hobbits-elves</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We arrived in the capital city of Wellington on Monday evening after 11 hours on a bus traversing the North Island from Auckland. We had a small taste of the beautiful scenery this country offers. It sometimes reminds you of the Costwalds in England with sheep grazing rocky hillsides and other times reminds you of the Pacific Northwest with tall, green conifers and long winding roads that lead you to a fantastic, rocky coastline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we arrived at the only hostel in town with tent sites, we were out of luck. Sites full. So we opted for a small, dingy room with bunk beds. The price was right. We&amp;#8217;re not sure, but there must be 60 or more rooms in the joint &amp;#8211; some with beds for 6 or more. We&amp;#8217;ve decided that there is definite money to be made in hostels &amp;#8211; especially when you don&amp;#8217;t have to pay for things like cleaning or general maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent Tuesday wandering aimlessly through the central city. Like Auckland, the central area of the city is not very big and can be easily covered on foot. We took in a few good museums. The national museum, Te Papa &amp;#8211; which covers natural history, immigration, and the history of the Maori people among other topics &amp;#8211; is especially nice. Interestingly, the museum is bilingual in English and Maori. We&amp;#8217;ve both noticed the prevalence of Maori language and culture in every day life. (Probably easy to appreciate once you&amp;#8217;ve taken all their land!)&lt;br&gt;
We have yet to see any hobbits or elves, but we did see the Paramount Theatre where the Return of the King premiered. Another really great thing about New Zealand is that the mega theaters offer super cheap Tuesdays. Regular priced movies are even more expensive here than in the U.S., but on Tuesdays you can find many theaters with $4-$7 movies all day long. Not bad when it&amp;#8217;s raining and you&amp;#8217;re on a budget!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflections on Sweet Potato, Pumpkin and Hokey Pokey</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/reflections-on-sweet-potato-pumpkin-and-hokey-pokey.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/reflections-on-sweet-potato-pumpkin-and-hokey-pokey</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The three things that stand out about food here in New Zealand are their love of (In order) Ice Cream, Pumpkins and Sweet Potatoes (known locally as Kumara).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s cover the last first, when I first saw it listed on the menu I just assumed that Kumara was a strange type of sausage. But it seems that Kumara is the name of a type of Polynesian sweet potato, brought here by the Maouri; and when combined with deep fryers, brought here by the English you have Kumara Fries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweet, sweet Kumara fries. If that isn&amp;#8217;t a lesson in the benefits of social integration between Europeans and the native Maouri nothing is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, pumpkins. Kiwi&amp;#8217;s can&amp;#8217;t get enough of them. They are pumpkin crazy! Of our first three meals here two of them had a pumpkin ingredients. You can find pumpkin in your curry, pumpkin in your hummus, pumpkin in your soup and pumpkin sliced or diced in your produce section &amp;#8211; when it&amp;#8217;s out of season. I&amp;#8217;m still investigating how this fascination with the pumpkin began, and my work is delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, Hokey Pokie &amp;#8211; or really ice cream in general &amp;#8211; or really dairy in general. They love it, which is good because there are a lot of cows down here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no convenience store here, they&amp;#8217;re called &amp;#8220;The Dairy&amp;#8221;. Milk and ice cream are everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
In the states we think we have flavored milk right? Chocolate milk is fun and tasty. Down here they have chocolate, banana, strawberry and &amp;#8230;lime. Yes! Lime flavored milk, but how does it taste you ask? Delicious. This is a million dollar idea they&amp;#8217;re sitting on, someone should patent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#8217;s ice cream. It&amp;#8217;s a national obsession, every day we see people eating it, LOTS of it. And the big kahuna of flavors is Hokey Pokey. I have no idea what it is, maybe just a mishmash of other flavors all rolled into one, but they can&amp;#8217;t get enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go, no need for &amp;#8216;Got Milk&amp;#8217; ad&amp;#8217;s down here, they have it covered. And if you&amp;#8217;re lactose intolerant, maybe they&amp;#8217;ll let you move to Australia, because you aren&amp;#8217;t going to do too well here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The City of Sails</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/the-city-of-sails.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/the-city-of-sails</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Auckland early Friday morning and spent three days there exploring the city. Since we only spent a few days in one city, it&amp;#8217;s probably not fair to make any kind of sweeping generalizations about Kiwis or New Zealand for that matter. Nevertheless, it&amp;#8217;s fun and we can always revise them later after a more thorough Kiwi experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Everyone is on vacation. We were aware that Kiwis take extended holiday at this time of year as it is their summer, but we were surprised just how serious they are about vacation. We passed numerous restaurants with signs stating, &amp;#8220;Closed December 23 to January 8th&amp;#8221; Can you imagine a restaurant in DC or New York just closing down for three weeks during the holidays? This can be the only explanation for why we didn&amp;#8217;t get the &amp;#8220;high energy&amp;#8221; Auckland experience promised by many brochures. That and because everything closes at 5pm!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The native trees and flora are quite beautiful. We enjoyed visiting a number of parks throughout Auckland. Sadly but not surprisingly, much of the native vegetation has been destroyed as the early settlers and Maori cleared way for agricultural and other interests. Still this place has some beautiful green spaces &amp;#8211; even in the cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They really, really do love the All Blacks, the national rugby team. Their national pride seems to ride on the shoulders of this team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Good food! Food is something I think we were both indifferent about prior to arriving in NZ, but we&amp;#8217;ve had some really good, cheap grub. First off, they love sweet potatoes and pumpkin and use both in a lot of dishes. A particular favorite of ours is eating at Burger Fuel &amp;#8211; where they don&amp;#8217;t dish up any lame Boca burgers. Oh no. The menu has not one, but four vegetarian burgers that include ingredients like sweet potato, chickpeas, sunflower seeds and cumin or basil served with plum or peanut sauces and aioli. And don&amp;#8217;t forget a side of sweet potato fries! It&amp;#8217;s truly vegetarian, fast food heaven!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Within the food subject, we have to single out ice cream for a little factoid. Kiwis apparently have the second highest consumption of ice cream per capita in the world. They even have a national flavor &amp;#8211; hokey pokey &amp;#8211; which is vanilla with toffee chunks. We can offer positive reports on the ice cream, but have yet to try the hokey pokey. I wonder if it makes you want to turn yourself about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Lee Anne&amp;#8217;s absolute favorite thing about Auckland is that at certain intersections downtown, you can walk diagonally through the intersection. It&amp;#8217;s brilliant! You don&amp;#8217;t have to cross to one corner then wait for another light and cross to the next corner. Nope. You just walk right where you want to go. It&amp;#8217;s simple, but still exciting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, after months of planning, preparations and daydreaming, we were off. Lee Anne&amp;#8217;s sister in law and niece Megan saw us off in Dallas, and we were on our way to our first stop &amp;#8211; New Zealand. Though we had checked in through to Auckland with United at DFW, we still had to check in again and obtain new boarding passes with Air New Zealand at LAX. It seemed odd and inefficient, but not a big deal. After all, we had three hours plus to kill at LAX. After a short wait, the gentlemen behind the counter reviewed our United issued boarding passed and our passports. &amp;#8220;And your return tickets?&amp;#8221; he asked. &amp;#8220;Uh&amp;#8230;oh&amp;#8230;well you see we&amp;#8217;re not actually coming back.&amp;#8221; we responded. &amp;#8220;Well you can not go then!&amp;#8221;, he responded in a very matter of fact way. We explained our situation to him. You see, we have a reservation that we will purchase in Auckland. And look here&amp;#8217;s our Indian visa. Doesn&amp;#8217;t that help? Long story short, we ended up purchasing two very overpriced, fully refundable one-way tickets from Auckland to Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airline understood our situation, but we absolutely had to comply with the law. Dave has since coined this the &amp;#8220;hippy law.&amp;#8221; Apparently, Kiwis have enough backpacking, hippies picking grapes and base jumping off of tall building. All told the ordeal cost us $150 service fee for issuing and then refunding tickets we don&amp;#8217;t need and about an hour at LAX. There&amp;#8217;s nothing else to do there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kia Aro from New Zealand!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/kia-aro-from-new-zealand.html"/>
        <updated>2007-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/kia-aro-from-new-zealand</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After fifteen hours of flights and four or so hours of lay-overs we&amp;#8217;ve arrived at our first destination: New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may say to yourself: &amp;#8220;Too Easy! An Around the world trip that starts half-way around the world, they&amp;#8217;re cheating.&amp;#8221; Well, yes maybe we are cheating. And if you would like to help finance a trip to backfill the Dallas to New Zealand segment please get in contact with us at once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, New Zealand is very far away. If you&amp;#8217;re reading this before you go to bed on the east coast in the states, we&amp;#8217;re getting ready for dinner &amp;#8230;the NEXT DAY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things lead us to start our trip in NZ: it&amp;#8217;s a soft landing, despite the jet-lag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  They speak English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  We have conntacts here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The exchange rate works in our favor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s suppose to have a terrifically beatiful and varied environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So compared to some of the other destinations on our itenerary (Mongolia, Namibia, to name only two), NZ is looking pretty easy to get our arms around. Let&amp;#8217;s hope it&amp;#8217;s a good place for us to start learning how to be round the world travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bonne Voyage!</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/bonne-voyage.html"/>

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/bonne-voyage</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember how you felt before you started your last Round the World trip? No? Let me remind you: It&amp;#8217;s really no sweat, you&amp;#8217;re only leaving home for several months, going to God knows what kind of places where you won&amp;#8217;t understand the locals, be familiar with their customs or know which way to look when you cross the street &amp;#8230;and that&amp;#8217;s just Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you&amp;#8217;re like LeeAnne and me and you haven&amp;#8217;t done this kind of thing before, let me tell you &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s exciting and fun and scary as hell at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is what your wedding day feels like (If unlike us you planned a wedding and had more than one guest invited). It&amp;#8217;s this thing that you&amp;#8217;ve been planning for and sweating the details about for months and you&amp;#8217;ve told all your friends about it and now it&amp;#8217;s all about to start tomorrow. So you&amp;#8217;re hoping that everything hangs together because there are too many details to go over at the last minute, and only once the cerimony starts is when you feel you can exhail. That&amp;#8217;s kind of where we&amp;#8217;re at right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So see you all soon, wish you were coming with us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://gothereandback.com/travel-gear/flickring-around-the-world</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hopefully soon we will have many many photos in here. We&amp;#8217;re using flickr to host photos while we&amp;#8217;re traveling. It&amp;#8217;s easy to upload stuff from internet cafes and it beats trying to store everything on our own, and then either losing them. Besides we can share them with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/packing-packing-packing.html"/>
        <updated>2006-12-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/packing-packing-packing</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow! We have a lot of stuff for two people traveling light around the world. It&amp;#8217;s embarrassing telling people your traveling around the world on a shoestring and then asking their help to pull your two large duffel bags, two fully packed back-packs and two or three carry-on&amp;#8217;s out of the car for you. Luckily, most people are forgiving, and after they have finished laughing at you they will throw in a hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not as bad as it seems; first of all, we haven&amp;#8217;t really even started our trip yet. We are at LeeAnnes parents house in Lisbon, Ohio for &amp;#8220;Second Christmas&amp;#8221;. While we are out of the house, and it will be some time before we see any parts of the east coast again, we aren&amp;#8217;t really traveling yet are we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a lot of this stuff will be shed in stages (by design, not just happenstance!). We&amp;#8217;re planning on biking and camping in New Zealand. After NZ we ditch the bike stuff, we&amp;#8217;ll be camping a lot in Austraila so we&amp;#8217;ll hold on to camping gear a bit longer but after Australia we ditch the that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you see, we need all this stuff &amp;#8230;right? Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m not convinced either.&lt;/p&gt;

        <updated>2006-12-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/mork-to-orson-come-in-orson</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing we&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of research on running up to the last days before we leave is telephones and phone cards. Keeping in touch with folks back home is really important to us so we want something reliable, but we also don&amp;#8217;t want to pay a lot for that muffler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telephony Without Hassel&lt;/strong&gt; 
We looked at Skype, GSM phones, etc. but phonecards just seemed like the easiest way to go. But since we&amp;#8217;re both turning off our cell phones we&amp;#8217;d like for there to be some way besides email for people back home to contact us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ekit.com&quot;&gt;eKit&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a global phonecard with access numbers in most of the places we&amp;#8217;re going and it offers subscribers voicemail accounts, eureka! Chocolate AND peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the Crackberry&lt;/strong&gt; 
The phonecard should cover 90% of our calls, but there was some concern about making emergency calls, recieving urgent calls from home, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s when our friend Lynn Reisdahll entered the picture. She works at T-Mobile and very generously offered to give us her old Blackberry 7100t. Convieniently, T-Mobile will unlock their subscribers phones for free so it was pretty easy to turn the phone into a GSM phone that will work on any network &amp;#8230;with the right SIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIM Hunting&lt;/strong&gt; 
There are a lot of SIM services out there. We plan on using two SIMs on the trip, both from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telestial.com/&quot;&gt;Telestial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telestial.com/view_product.php?PRODUCT_ID=MSIM-EX01&quot;&gt;SIM Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; It&amp;#8217;s has great rates, free incoming calls in many countries and coverage everywhere we&amp;#8217;ll be traveling except Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telestial.com/view_product.php?PRODUCT_ID=MSIM-MB01&quot;&gt;Mobal SIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Crappy rates, but good coverage, especially in Africa. So that&amp;#8217;s probably the only place we&amp;#8217;ll use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the phonecard/GSM phone combo is what we&amp;#8217;re going with swapping out SIM&amp;#8217;s as needed to get the best coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plan D</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/plan-d.html"/>
        <updated>2006-12-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/plan-d</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, this one is our bad. After getting screwed by the Irish travel agency back at Thanksgiving we decided on another course of action. &amp;#8220;Originating&amp;#8221; our OWE flight in the UK. It was going to be great, we would fly there for a few hundred, maybe catch a soccer game, stop in Dallas to see LeeAnnes family on the way to New Zealand and be on with our trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s before we waited two weeks to get the flight to the UK. Now the prices are a lot higher to get there and that again puts us in a situation where, we are making a lot of very tight turn arounds during the holidays and not saving very much cash. I really wished we would have bought the London tickets when we formulated this plan, but we were so exhausted from the whole Ireland thing we just dropped it. 
So now the plan is this: We originate our flight in&amp;#8230; (drumroll please) New Zealand! Thank you, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will pick up the hit of the tickets to NZ, but originating in NZ is still even cheaper than the UK, and WAY cheaper than the US. And we won&amp;#8217;t burn any of our North American segments of our OWE tickets so once we get back to the US we can pop around a bit and visit some folks we don&amp;#8217;t often get to see. There are benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this time I am buying the tickets to our originating country as soon as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;#8217;s review our history of iteneraries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Plan A &amp;#8211; US Depature &amp;#8211; Too Expensive, let&amp;#8217;s get it cheaper somewhere else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Plan B &amp;#8211; Ireland Depature &amp;#8211; Cheaper, but the Travel Agents gave us the wrong price. Not as cheap as we had hoped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Plan C &amp;#8211; UK Depature &amp;#8211; We screwed ourselves and now the cost of the flight over negates most of the savings we would have seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Plan D &amp;#8211; New Zealand Depature &amp;#8211; Still cheaper! Significantly streamlines our flights during the holidays, and gives us flights in the US after our RTW trip is over. Who could ask for anything more?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let us never speak of it again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Itinerary &#8211; For Now&#8230;</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/the-itenerary-for-now.html"/>
        <updated>2006-11-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/the-itenerary-for-now</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, the Irish screwed us. After going through everything, AND running our credit card they told us (by email) that they had quoted us for the wrong price. And it would be about 1,000 euros more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#8217;t follow the currency market like I should, but I do know that right now the exchange rate for US Dollars to Euros is no good, and a thousand Euros is &amp;#8230;well, more that we want to pay. So this kind of kills the incentive to use this travel agent (ever).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the travel agents fees, the taxes and the price of flying to get there, we weren&amp;#8217;t going to save very much money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#8217;s next? Now we are looking at flights to the UK. LeeAnnes brother lives there and could purchase the tickets for use. The tickets are actually cheaper there than in Ireland, and it&amp;#8217;s a little cheaper to get there. The downside is the trip would be over when we connect on any flights through Heathrow. And since British Airways is the main OneWorld partner in Europe, that means almost all the flights out of Africa go throough the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ticket Plan B &amp;#8211; Okay, so we&amp;#8217;re going to use a travel agent in Ireland to purchase our RTW tickets, fly there a few days before we &amp;#8220;Originate&amp;#8221; our One World Explorer tickets and then fly to New Zealand. Crazy, yes, but it&amp;#8217;s going to save us a bunch on ticket costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re been talking with some very helpful folks over the past few days at Trailfinders in Dublin. They&amp;#8217;ll be able to purchase the tickets for us at an Ireland price. And they have offices in Australia, so if we decide to rent a car there, we may use them there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One World Explorer Pricelist by Country</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, so one thing we learned very quickly from the One World Explorer FAQ is that OWE tickets are priced differently in every country they are sold in. Is that crazy or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, we were planning on flying from the states for 4,900 USD plus tax. But, having just learned that the US is the second highest prices ticket in the world (behind only &amp;#8230;Morrocco?), we are considering our options&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A departure from the UK looks good, almost 1/2 what we would pay in the US. But there is a nasty rule about not being able to connect through your country of origin after you have departed from it. So, now we are thinking of flying to Ireland (not quite as cheap, but still cheap), making that our country of origin, and then flying back over the US to get to New Zealand. Flying around our elbow to get to our asshole? Yes. But it will save us a bundle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tickets &#8211; One World Explorer</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve researched a lot of different options on Round the World tickets. It&amp;#8217;s a great way to control your costs on getting there and back, because after you pay a flat fee you can use as many or as few flights as you want too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the major airline alliances offer some sort of RTW ticket, and most are based on the number of miles flown. For example: Star Alliance has RTW ticket that allows you to fly up to 39,000 miles, which sounds like a lot, until you try to go from North America, Australia, Asia, Africa, and Europe all in those 39,000 miles and you end up with a number like 41,000 or 43,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are trying to hit both Australia and Africa (via Asia) the milage capped programs just aren&amp;#8217;t going to work for us. Enter the One World Alliance Explorer ticket. Rather than miles your are capped by zones. We will use 5 zones (N. America, Australia, Asia, Africa &amp;#038; Europe). The price is 4,900 USD plus taxes, etc. and you get up to 20 flights. So it looks like a pretty sweet deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still learning a lot about it, but this FAQ has been invauable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Going hand-in-hand with vaccinations is Travel Insurance. I&amp;#8217;ve been out and about in the world before, but have never even considered getting it. But, this is a big trip and we are grown up now, so it seems like a good time to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment we are looking at a few providers, but our friends Jim &amp;amp; Dara have recommended IMG Global. It&amp;#8217;s pretty comprehensive coverage. The deductibles are scaleable, and it provides up to two months of coverage after your trip ends and you&amp;#8217;re back in the states. That&amp;#8217;s pretty sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we will use: IMG Global&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bicycle Hire in New Zealand</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/bicycle-hire-new-zealand.html"/>
        <updated>2006-11-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/new-zealand/bicycle-hire-new-zealand</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a couple of months we have been considering trying to work in some Bicycle touring as part of our travel. It didn&amp;#8217;t take too long to identfy New Zealand as the place we wanted to do it in. It&amp;#8217;s suppose to be one of the best places in the world for touring and camping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision that did cause a lot of gnashing of teeth is: should we take our own bikes and ship them back when we&amp;#8217;re done in New Zealand, or should we rent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best case senario would be to take our own bikes and ship them home on a slow boat. But we have had some trouble figuring out how much that would cost and how long it would take. Plus, it&amp;#8217;s always a bit of a hassle to get the bikes boxed and on the plans. So, we have decided to rent. It will probably cost less and save wear-and-tear on our own equipment. It helps that we found a bike co-op in Auckland (called Adventure Cycles) that seem very friendly and knowledgeable about things. Their contact details are below.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vaccinations&#8230; Don&#8217;t Leave Home Without Them</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/vaccinations.html"/>
        <updated>2006-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/travel-expenses/vaccinations</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First stop on the road to Round the World Travel is the Doctors office. It may not be the most romantic or adventuresome idea, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that before the best adventurers and explorers headed out they got their shots. How much could Indiana Jones have gotten done if he were bed-ridden with Hep B while chasing the Ark of the Covanent? Not much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for us we are based in Washington D.C. where there are a number of clinics that specialize in World Travel. After doing some shopping around we have decided to use the services of &amp;#8220;Travelers Medical&amp;#8221; on K St. They seem to us the best balance of cost, pratical advice, and experience. Contact detals are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, vaccinations are not cheap: We will probably drop around $1000 USD, on shots, vaccinations and anti-malarials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As LeeAnne is a RPCV (Returned Peace Corp Volunteer) she is way in front of me in terms of vaccinations. I will need the works, even my Tetnis boosters are behind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Word About Why We Are on this Trip</title>
        <link href="http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/hello-world.html"/>
        <updated>2006-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://gothereandback.com/pre-trip-preperation/hello-world</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe we need to explain a little about why we are doing this: LeeAnne and I have always had a bit of the wander lust. She&amp;#8217;s a Returned Peace Corp Volunteer and I&amp;#8217;m know in my office as &amp;#8220;The Guy That Leaves, But Then Comes Back&amp;#8221;, or &amp;#8220;TGTLBTCB&amp;#8221; for short. I tend to take months long sebaticals to ride my bike across the US or Australia, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s probably a good thing we found each other. We have been planning something like this trip since before we were married in August 2004. But why exactly? Couldn&amp;#8217;t tell you. There&amp;#8217;s somthing about both of us that wants to get out there and see our share of the world. That&amp;#8217;s about the best way I can sum it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 2007 will be our year to travel, experience and hopefully learn a little bit more about our share of what&amp;#8217;s out there. Will this cure our wanderlust? Probably not, but it should slack our thirst for a while, and hopefully we will be the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
